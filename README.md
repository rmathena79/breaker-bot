# Notes

Transcribers' notes would also be good to remove but I'm not sure they are standardized well.

To be fully normalized -- I should probably have tables for titles and urls too
    
Tests?

Should I store the character set in the DB too?

Tools need options for
samples vs full dataset
db credentials for each

Might be nice to encrypt each file multiple times
