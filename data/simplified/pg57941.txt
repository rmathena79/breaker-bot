8. EQUIPMENT FOR SHIP OPERATION.

=A. GENERAL.= THIS PARAGRAPH DESCRIBES BRIEFLY THE MAJOR ITEMS OF
EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR THE OPERATION OF THE SHIP.

=B. NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT.=

(1) COMPASSES.

(A) THE SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH MAGNETIC AND GYROCOMPASSES. THE MASTER
GYROCOMPASS IS LOCATED BELOW DECKS IN THE GYRO-ROOM. THE READINGS
OF THIS COMPASS ARE TRANSMITTED TO REPEATERS, WHICH ARE SIMILAR IN
APPEARANCE TO MAGNETIC COMPASSES AND ARE PLACED IN THE PILOT HOUSE AND
AT OTHER POINTS WHERE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHIPS HEADING IS REQUIRED.
GYROCOMPASS EQUIPMENT INCLUDES THE MASTER COMPASS AND ITS SUPPORTS,
BATTERIES, A MOTOR-GENERATOR SET FOR SUPPLYING POWER IN CASE OF FAILURE
OF THE SHIPS SUPPLY, INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND A PANEL FOR FUSES AND
SWITCHES FOR THE REPEATERS.

(B) THE MAGNETIC COMPASS IS IN THE PILOT HOUSE. IT IS MOUNTED IN
A COMPENSATING BINNACLE THAT NEUTRALIZES OR COMPENSATES FOR ERRORS
INTRODUCED INTO THE COMPASS BY THE MAGNETIC MATERIALS ON THE SHIP. (SEE
FIGS. 8 AND 9.)

(2) PELORUS. A PELORUS IS MOUNTED ON EACH WING OF THE NAVIGATING
BRIDGE. THE PELORUS IS A GRADUATED CIRCLE MOUNTED IN GIMBALS WITH AN
ALIDADE PIVOTED OVER ITS CENTER. IT IS USED TO MEASURE DIRECTIONS TO
SOME DISTANT POINT LIKE ANOTHER SHIP OR AN OBJECT ON LAND. IT GIVES THE
BEARING RELATIVE TO THE SHIPS HEADING OR, IF SET TO THE SHIPS TRUE

(3) RADIO DIRECTION FINDER. LOCATED ON THE NAVIGATING BRIDGE IS THE
SHIPS RADIO DIRECTION FINDER. THIS INSTRUMENT RECEIVES RADIO SIGNALS
AND ESTABLISHES THE BEARING OF THE SENDING STATION. IT CONSISTS
ESSENTIALLY OF A LOOP ANTENNA FOR RECEIVING THE SIGNALS CONNECTED TO A
RADIO RECEIVER THAT MAKES THE SIGNALS AUDIBLE. THE POSITION OF THE SHIP
MAY BE DETERMINED FROM RADIO BEARINGS BY TAKING CROSS BEARINGS ON TWO
OR MORE STATIONS, BY TWO BEARINGS ON THE SAME STATION AND THE DISTANCE
RUN BETWEEN BEARINGS, AND BY A BEARING AND A SOUNDING.

(4) FATHOMETER.

(A) A FATHOMETER IS INSTALLED ON THE NAVIGATING BRIDGE TO DETERMINE
THE DEPTH OF WATER UNDER THE SHIP. THIS INSTRUMENT WORKS ON THE ECHO
DEPTH-FINDING PROCESS. BRIEFLY, IT CONSISTS OF A SUBMARINE OSCILLATOR
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP THAT PRODUCES A SOUND OF SUFFICIENT INTENSITY
TO TRAVEL TO THE OCEAN FLOOR AND REFLECT BACK TO A SENSITIVE RECEIVER
ALSO LOCATED IN THE SHIPS BOTTOM. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TIME OF
SENDING THE SOUND AND RECEIVING THE ECHO IS MEASURED BY THE FATHOMETER,
TRANSLATED INTO DEPTH, AND FLASHED ON THE DIAL AS A RED LIGHT OPPOSITE
A NUMERAL CORRESPONDING TO THE DEPTH IN FATHOMS.

(B) NEAR THE FATHOMETER IS A FATHOMETER RECORDER THAT RECORDS ON
A PAPER CHART THE DEPTHS INDICATED BY THE FATHOMETER. THIS GIVES A
CONTINUOUS DEPTH PROFILE OF THE OCEAN BOTTOM ALONG THE SHIPS COURSE.

(5) CHARTROOM EQUIPMENT. IN THE CHARTROOM ARE SEXTANTS, PROTRACTORS,
DIVIDERS, PARALLEL RULES, CHRONOMETER, HYDROGRAPHIC CHARTS, AND A CHART
TABLE.

=C. COMMUNICATIONS.=

10-1.

(2) RADIO TELEPHONE. RADIO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION IS HANDLED
BY THE SHORT-WAVE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER. (SEE FIG. 11.) THEY
OPERATE ON FREQUENCIES BETWEEN 2 AND 3 MILLION CYCLES PER SECOND WITH
SEPARATE CHANNELS DESIGNATED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. FOR SHIP-TO-SHORE
COMMUNICATION, FREQUENCIES RANGE BETWEEN 2,100 AND 2,200 KILOCYCLES.
DIRECT SHIP-TO-SHIP COMMUNICATION IS ON 2,738 KILOCYCLES. THE SETS THUS
SEND AND RECEIVE ON DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES.

(3) VISUAL SIGNAL EQUIPMENT.

(A) FLASHING LIGHT SIGNALS. FLASHING LIGHT SIGNALS ARE MADE WITH A
DOT-AND-DASH BLINKER LIGHT. THE LIGHT IS ON TOP OF THE PILOT HOUSE FOR
GREATER VISIBILITY AND IS MOUNTED SO IT CAN BE SHONE IN ANY DIRECTION.

RUNNING PARTS EXCEPT THE PISTONS, WHICH ARE LUBRICATED BY OIL THROWN
INTO THE CYLINDER WALLS BY THE CRANKS; AND AN INDIRECT COOLING SYSTEM
IN WHICH CLEAN SOFT WATER IS CIRCULATED IN A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND COOLED
BY SEA WATER IN THE HEAT EXCHANGERS. THE FUEL SYSTEM USES A MANIFOLD
IN WHICH FUEL IS MAINTAINED AT CONSTANT PRESSURE BUT IN WHICH THERE IS
NO PRESSURE ON THE INJECTION VALVES EXCEPT DURING THE ACTUAL TIME OF
INJECTION.

=E. AUXILIARY ENGINES.= DIESEL AND GASOLINE AUXILIARY ENGINES FURNISH
POWER FOR THE SHIPS GENERATORS, COMPRESSORS, AND PUMPS. TYPICAL OF THE

(D) WHARF CRANES AND DEBRIS WERE BLOWN INTO CHANNELS ALONGSIDE
WHARVES AND QUAYS. (SEE FIGS. 49 THROUGH 53.)

15. OPERATIONS OF PORT REPAIR SHIP IN A CAPTURED PORT.

=A. GENERAL.= THE PORT COMMANDER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESTORATION OF
THE PORTS FACILITIES. HE ORDERS SURVEYS MADE OF THE EXTENT AND NATURE
OF THE DAMAGE AND FROM THEM DETERMINES WHAT WORK IS TO BE DONE AND WHO
IS TO DO IT, SETS PRIORITIES, AND ESTIMATES TIME, PERSONNEL, MATERIALS,
AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. BEFORE ACTUAL REPAIRS CAN BE STARTED, THE
FOLLOWING PREPARATORY WORK USUALLY HAS TO BE DONE BY ARMY AND NAVY
UNITS:

 (1) EXTINGUISH FIRES AND DEMOLISH UNSAFE STRUCTURES.
 (2) SWEEP MINES.
 (3) REMOVE BLOCKSHIPS.
 (4) REMOVE BOOMS AND TORPEDO NETS.
 (5) NEUTRALIZE LAND MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS.
 (6) INSTALL AA AND OTHER PROTECTIVE WORKS.
 (7) REMOVE DEBRIS IN WATER AND ON QUAYS.
 (8) REMOVE OBSTRUCTIONS FROM EXITS TO WHARF AREAS.

ENEMY DID A SYSTEMATIC JOB OF SINKING SHIPS TO BLOCK THE HARBOR AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE.]

FREIGHTER. TRUCKS ARE USING IT TO UNLOAD A LIBERTY SHIP.]

(9) INSTALL NAVIGATION AIDS AND MOORINGS.

=B.= FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE JOBS THE PORT REPAIR SHIP MIGHT BE
REQUIRED TO DO:

(1) INSTALL NAVIGATION AIDS IN ENTRANCE CHANNEL. AFTER THE HARBOR
AREA HAS BEEN SWEPT OF MINES BY THE NAVY, THE PORT REPAIR SHIP MARKS
THE ENTRANCE CHANNEL WITH BUOYS. THIS IS DONE BY SOUNDINGS AND BY USING
HYDROGRAPHIC CHARTS OF THE HARBOR. SOUNDINGS ARE MADE BY THE SHIPS
FATHOMETER, BY LEAD LINES, AND BY A PORTABLE DEPTH FINDER. THE PORTABLE
DEPTH FINDER WORKS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS THE SHIPS FATHOMETER
(PAR. 8) AND IS INSTALLED ON ONE OF THE TWO POWERBOATS. THE POWERBOAT
OPERATES AHEAD OF THE PORT REPAIR SHIP, TAKES CONTINUAL SOUNDINGS,
AND MARKS THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CHANNEL. THE CREW OF THE POWERBOAT IS
CONSTANTLY ON THE ALERT FOR UNDERWATER OBSTRUCTIONS AND SIGNALS THE
SHIP IF ANY ARE FOUND AND WHETHER THE SHIP MUST CHANGE HER COURSE OR
STOP.

(2) BLOCKSHIPS.

(A) A BLOCKSHIP IS A PREPARED UNDERWATER OBSTACLE SUNK TO PREVENT
SHIPS FROM FOLLOWING NAVIGABLE CHANNELS. ONE OR MORE BLOCKSHIPS MAY BE
FOUND IN AN ENTRANCE CHANNEL. THESE SHIPS ARE OFTEN FILLED WITH ROCK OR
CONCRETE TO MAKE THEM MORE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.

(B) WHEN SOUNDINGS, INTELLIGENCE REPORTS, OR INFORMATION RECEIVED
FROM THE MINESWEEPERS INDICATE THE LOCATION OF A BLOCKSHIP, A DIVER IS
SENT DOWN FOR RECONNAISSANCE. THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE
COURSE OF ACTION IS

 1. POSITION BLOCKSHIP IS IN. THAT IS, IS IT ON ITS SIDE, AT AN ANGLE,
 OR RESTING ON ITS KEEL.

 2. APPROXIMATE SIZE AND TYPE OF VESSEL.

 3. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ITS SUPERSTRUCTURE.

 4. WOULD THE REMOVAL OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE LEAVE
 ENOUGH WATER BETWEEN THE HULL AND THE SURFACE FOR LARGE VESSELS TO
 USE THE CHANNEL?

[ILLUSTRATION: FIGURE 53. TWO HALF-SUNKEN SHIPS AND THE BOMB CRATER
IN HARBORS SEAWALL AND QUAY SHOW THE RESULTS OF WELL-PLANNED
DESTRUCTION.]

 5. NATURE OF BOTTOM AND EFFECT OF CURRENTS.

 6. IS SHIP FILLED WITH ROCK OR CONCRETE?

 7. INDICATIONS OF MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS.

(C) THIS INFORMATION DETERMINES WHETHER THE SUPERSTRUCTURE CAN BE CUT
THROUGH OR FLATTENED WITH EXPLOSIVES OR IF THE HULL HAS TO BE BROKEN UP
BEFORE THE CHANNEL IS CLEARED. DESTROYING THE HULL IS A LONG, DIFFICULT
TASK AND SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IF THE REMOVAL OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE
AFFORDS ENOUGH CLEARANCE.

(3) HARBOR.

(A) GENERAL. WHEN THE PORT REPAIR SHIP ENTERS THE HARBOR,
HER MASTER REPORTS TO THE PORT COMMANDER FOR INSTRUCTIONS. THESE
INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDE

 1. WHAT JOBS THE SHIP IS TO DO AND WHAT PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN SET ON
 THEM.

 2. WHAT MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, POWER, TOOLS, AND PERSONNEL THE SHIP IS
 TO FURNISH THE PORT CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR GROUP.

 3. WHETHER TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION OR REPAIRS ARE TO BE MADE OR
 PERMANENT REPAIRS MADE.

 4. SURVEYS TO BE MADE OF UNDERWATER DAMAGE AND OBSTRUCTIONS IN HARBOR
 AREA.

(B) REMOVAL OF SMALL SUNKEN CRAFT AND DEBRIS. SMALL BOATS USUALLY
ARE SUNK ALONGSIDE WHARVES AND QUAYS TO PREVENT SHIPS FROM APPROACHING
CLOSE ENOUGH TO UNLOAD. ALSO, CRANES AND SECTIONS OF THE WHARVES BLOWN
INTO THE WATER HAVE TO BE REMOVED. DIVERS EXAMINE THE DEBRIS AND
DETERMINE WHETHER IT CAN BE PULLED OUT OF THE WAY INTO DEEPER WATER
OR IF IT FIRST MUST BE BROKEN UP. SINCE THE USE OF LARGE QUANTITIES
OF EXPLOSIVES MAY FURTHER DAMAGE ADJACENT QUAYS AND PIERS, DEBRIS TOO
HEAVY AND BULKY TO HOIST AND DRAG IS CUT INTO SMALLER SECTIONS BY
UNDERWATER CUTTING. THEN THESE SECTIONS ARE RAISED BY THE CATHEAD AND
PULLED OUT OF THE WAY BY THE SHIP. SMALL, SUNKEN CRAFT OFTEN CAN BE
SALVAGED BY SEALING UP THE HULLS AND PUMPING OUT THE WATER WITH SALVAGE
PUMPS. THIS TYPE OF SALVAGE WORK CAN BE DONE FROM THE 50-TON BARGE
WHICH LEAVES THE REPAIR SHIP FREE FOR OTHER JOBS.

(C) FURNISHING MATERIALS, POWER, AND EQUIPMENT.

 1. MATERIALS. MATERIALS REQUIRED BY THE PORT GROUP TO START ITS
 WORK CAN BE FURNISHED IN LIMITED QUANTITIES BY THE REPAIR SHIP.
 HOWEVER UNTIL CARGO SHIPS CAN UNLOAD AT THE PORT, THE GROUP MUST
 GET LOCALLY THE BULK OF THE MATERIALS IT NEEDS. THE SMALL AMOUNT OF
 CEMENT, TIMBERS, AND STRUCTURAL STEEL THAT THE SHIP CARRIES CAN BE
 PUT ASHORE ON THE SHIPS BARGE.

 2. POWER. UNTIL LOCAL SOURCES OF POWER ARE RESTORED OR FLOATING
 POWER PLANTS ARE AVAILABLE, POWER FOR LIGHTING AND FOR OPERATING
 EQUIPMENT IS SUPPLIED BY THE SHIPS STATIONARY AND PORTABLE
 GENERATORS AND COMPRESSORS.

 3. EQUIPMENT. SUCH PORTABLE EQUIPMENT AS THE CLAMSHELL BUCKET,
 WELDING AND CUTTING OUTFITS, TRAILER-MOUNTED FIRE PUMPER, AND
 PNEUMATIC TOOLS, IS TURNED OVER TO THE GROUP AS IT IS NEEDED.
 IF NECESSARY, EQUIPMENT OPERATORS ARE FURNISHED FROM THE SHIPS
 PERSONNEL.

(D) USE OF THE SHIPS SHOPS. THE SHIPS SHOPS ARE USED TO MAKE
PARTS FOR AND TO REPAIR PORT MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. TYPICAL JOBS ARE
TO REPAIR ENGINES AND MOTORS AND TO CONSTRUCT OR REPAIR CARGO-HANDLING
EQUIPMENT.

(E) UNDERWATER CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIRS. THE SHIPS DIVERS MAY
BE REQUIRED TO REPAIR THE UNDERWATER STRUCTURES OF DAMAGED PIERS AND
QUAYS. BROKEN OR WEAKENED PILINGS OR TIMBERS MAY HAVE TO BE CUT AND
REMOVED SO NEW ONES CAN BE PLACED. ALSO, THE FOUNDATIONS OF HARBOR
BREAKWATERS OR SEA WALLS MAY REQUIRE STRENGTHENING OR REPAIRS.

=C. SAFETY OF SHIP.= WHILE OPERATING IN THE CLOSE WATERS OF THE HARBOR,
ESPECIALLY WHILE THREATENED WITH THE ADDITIONAL HAZARDS OF DEBRIS,
MINES, UNDERWATER OBSTACLES, AND ENEMY AIR ATTACK, THE SAFETY OF THE
SHIP IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. THE MASTER OF THE SHIP IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER SAFETY. HE SEES THAT THE GUN CREWS ARE AT THEIR STATIONS AND
THAT ENOUGH DECKHANDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE EXTRA WORK REQUIRED IN
MOORING AND MANEUVERING.

=D. SUMMARY.= SPEED IS ESSENTIAL IN PORT REPAIR WORK TO ELIMINATE THE
NECESSITY OF LANDING TROOPS, STORES, AND EQUIPMENT OVER BEACHES FOR ANY
LENGTH OF TIME. THE ENGINEER PORT REPAIR SHIP HAS AN IMPORTANT PART
IN GETTING THIS WORK STARTED BY OPENING THE HARBOR TO NAVIGATION AND
BY FURNISHING POWER, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES TO THE PORT CONSTRUCTION
AND REPAIR GROUPS. THE SHOPS ON THE SHIP HELP PREVENT STOPPAGES CAUSED
BY BREAKDOWN OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY CAN REPAIR OR
MANUFACTURE ESSENTIAL PARTS THAT MAY BE NEEDED. IN SHORT, THE PORT
REPAIR SHIP IS THE SPEARHEAD IN GETTING PORT RECONSTRUCTION WORK UNDER
WAY AND, BY ITS ABILITY TO DO MANY DIFFERENT TASKS, HELPS TO SPEED UP
THIS WORK AND KEEP IT GOING.
