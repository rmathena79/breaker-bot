STARTING ENGINE ON GRADE. CAUTION: BRAKE IS TO BE APPLIED LIGHTLY AND
CAUTIOUSLY ON WET AND SLIPPERY ROADS.

=H. GEAR SHIFTER= (FIG. 8). SHIFTER LEVER IS LOCATED ON LEFT TANK,
FORWARD POSITION, AND OPERATES WITHIN A GUIDE. SHIFTER LEVER GUIDE IS
NOTCHED FOR POSITIVE LOCATION OF GEARS AND EACH POSITION IS IDENTIFIED,
FRONT TO REAR: 1LOW GEAR; NNEUTRAL; 2SECOND GEAR; 3DIRECT
HIGH GEAR.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310206

FIGURE 9CARBURETOR CHOKE LEVER POSITIONS]

=I. STEERING DAMPER.= STEERING DAMPER IS AN ADJUSTABLE FRICTION
DEVICE TO DAMPER TURNING ACTION OF FORKS, STEADY FRONT WHEEL, AND
PREVENT WOBBLE IN ROUGH TERRAIN OR AT HIGH SPEEDS, AND IS LOCATED ON
TOP OF STEERING HEAD IN CENTER OF HANDLE BARS. MOVE HANDLE TO RIGHT TO
APPLY DESIRED FRICTION.

=J. FOOT STARTER CRANK= (FIG. 1). THE FOOT STARTER CRANK IS LOCATED
ON RIGHT SIDE OF MOTORCYCLE. GEAR SHIFTER LEVER MUST BE IN NEUTRAL
POSITION, AND CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL IN FORWARD ENGAGED POSITION, BEFORE
USING FOOT STARTER CRANK. STARTER CRANK NORMALLY IS IN UPWARD POSITION.
STRADDLE MOTORCYCLE, PLACE RIGHT FOOT ON STARTER CRANK, AND SHIFT
WEIGHT OF BODY FOR FORCEFUL DOWNWARD CRANK OPERATION TO START ENGINE.

=K. IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH.= EARLIER MODELS ARE PROVIDED
WITH SWITCH LOCK, LATER MODELS ARE NONLOCKING. SWITCH IS OFF IN
STRAIGHTFORWARD POSITION. FIRST POSITION TO RIGHT IS FOR ENGINE
IGNITION ONLY. SECOND POSITION TO RIGHT IS FOR IGNITION AND BLACKOUT
LIGHTS. TO USE VEHICLE SERVICE LIGHTS, DEPRESS BUTTON TO TURN SWITCH TO
THIRD RIGHT POSITION.

=L. INSTRUMENT PANEL SIGNAL LIGHTS.= INSTEAD OF AN AMMETER AND OIL
PRESSURE GAGE, SIGNAL LIGHTS INDICATE GENERATOR CHARGING, AND ENGINE
OIL PRESSURE.

(1) GREEN LIGHT IS LOCATED ON LEFT SIDE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL. WHEN
ENGINE IS RUNNING, AND LIGHT IS OUT, IT INDICATES GENERATOR IS CHARGING.

(2) RED LIGHT IS LOCATED ON RIGHT SIDE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL. WHEN ENGINE
IS RUNNING, AND LIGHT IS OUT, IT INDICATES ENGINE OIL IS CIRCULATING.

=M. CARBURETOR CHOKE= (FIG. 9). CHOKE LEVER IS IN FULL PRIME POSITION
WHEN ALL THE WAY UP, AND IN NORMAL RUNNING POSITION WHEN ALL THE WAY
DOWN.

6. ENGINE PRESTARTING INSTRUCTIONS.

=A.= BEFORE THE ENGINE IS STARTED, PERFORM THE BEFOREOPERATION SERVICE
OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 15. SPECIAL CARE MUST BE TAKEN DURING STARTING
AND WARMINGUP PERIOD TO AVOID UNNECESSARY ENGINE WEAR.

=B.= THE RIDER MUST ACQUIRE CORRECT MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTING HABITS,
AND LEARN TO DO THE JOB THE QUICKEST, EASIEST, AND MOST DEPENDABLE WAY.
THE FOLLOWING POINTERS WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE BEGINNER AS WELL AS TO A
SEASONED RIDER:

(1) MOUNT (STRADDLE) MOTORCYCLE TO OBTAIN FIRM GRIP ON HANDLE BARS.

(2) LEAVE SIDE STAND (JIFFY STAND) OUTWARD TO SUPPORT VEHICLE WHILE
OPERATING FOOT STARTER CRANK WITH RIGHT FOOT.

(3) ENGINE STARTING WILL BE BENEFITED BY USE OF FRONT WHEEL,
HANDOPERATED BRAKE, TO PREVENT VEHICLE FROM ROLLING OR SHIFTING DURING
STARTING KICKS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IF VEHICLE IS PARKED ON AN
INCLINE OR ON SOFT, UNEVEN SURFACE.

=C.= THE PROCEDURE OUTLINED BELOW IS PREPARATORY TO STARTING EITHER
COLD, WARM, OR HOT ENGINE:

(1) PLACE GEAR SHIFTER LEVER IN N (NEUTRAL) POSITION (FIG. 8).

(2) SEE THAT GASOLINE SHUTOFF VALVE IS OPEN (FIG. 5).

(3) ENGAGE CLUTCH (FIG. 7).

(4) SPARK CONTROL (LEFT) GRIP MUST BE TURNED INWARD TO FULLY ADVANCED
POSITION, OR NEARLY SO.

(5) FOOT STARTER CRANK MAY TRAVEL 1/2 WAY DOWNWARD BEFORE STARTING
ENGINE. SEE THAT A FULL VIGOROUS STARTER STROKE IS USED. A VIGOROUS
KICK, USING A FULL SWING (NOT A JAB) OF RIGHT LEG AND HIP, IS CORRECT
ENGINE STARTING PRACTICE.

7. STARTING THE ENGINE.

=A.= PROCEDURE FOR STARTING COLD, WARM, OR HOT MOTORCYCLE ENGINES
DIFFERS. THEREFORE, FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE USED WITH PARAGRAPH 6 C
TO COVER CORRECT PROCEDURE IN ALL THREE CASES.

=B. STARTING COLD ENGINE.= WHEN VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN OPERATED FOR
SOME TIME, AND ENGINE IS NORMALLY COLD, FOLLOW PROGRESSIVE PROCEDURE
FOR EASIEST STARTING.

(1) SET CARBURETOR CHOKE LEVER IN FULL UPWARD (CLOSED) POSITION.

(2) OPEN THROTTLE WIDE BY TURNING RIGHT GRIP INWARD AS FAR AS IT WILL
GO.

(3) PRIME CYLINDERS BY OPERATING FOOT STARTER CRANK ONE OR TWO STROKES.

(4) SET CARBURETOR CHOKE LEVER IN 1/4 TO 1/2 CLOSED POSITION FOR MILD
WEATHER STARTING: 3/4 CLOSED (OR LEAVE FULLY CHOKED) FOR EXTREMELY COLD
WEATHER STARTING. CAUTION: IT IS ONLY IN EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER
THAT ENGINE MAY START BEST WITH CHOKE FULLY CLOSED, AND EVEN THEN IT
WILL HAVE TO BE MOVED FROM THIS POSITION IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENGINE IS
STARTED.

(5) SET THROTTLE (RIGHT) GRIP TO SLIGHTLY OPEN POSITION.

(6) TURN IGNITION SWITCH ON, FIRST RIGHT POSITION.

(7) START ENGINE WITH VIGOROUS STROKES OF FOOT STARTER CRANK.

(8) WHEN ENGINE STARTS, SET THROTTLE FOR MODERATE IDLING SPEED FOR
WARMING UP, OR UNTIL READY TO SET VEHICLE IN MOTION. DO NOT RACE ENGINE
UNNECESSARILY.

(9) AFTER ENGINE WARMS UP, AND MISFIRES DUE TO AN OVERRICH MIXTURE,
GRADUALLY MOVE CHOKE LEVER DOWNWARD. AFTER ENGINE HAS THOROUGHLY WARMED
UP, MOVE CHOKE LEVER TO FULLY OPEN (DOWNWARD) POSITION.

=C. STARTING WARM ENGINE.= FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS APPLY TO ENGINE
WHEN HALFWAY BETWEEN HOT AND COLD. WITH ENGINE IN THIS CONDITION,
CARBURETOR CHOKING MUST BE HANDLED CAUTIOUSLY.

(1) LIFT CHOKE LEVER TO FIRST UPWARD POSITION FROM NORMAL (1/4 CLOSED).

(2) SET THROTTLE (RIGHT) GRIP TO FULLY CLOSED (OUTWARD) POSITION.

(3) OPERATE FOOT STARTER CRANK ONE OR TWO STROKES.

(4) SET THROTTLE GRIP TO BETWEEN 1/4 AND 1/3 OPEN POSITION.

(5) TURN IGNITION SWITCH ON.

(6) START ENGINE WITH VIGOROUS STROKES OF FOOT STARTER CRANK.

(7) SOON AFTER ENGINE STARTS, CHOKE LEVER MUST BE MOVED TO FULLY OPEN
(DOWNWARD) POSITION.

(8) TURN THROTTLE GRIP TO CONTROL IDLING SPEED OF ENGINE.

=D. STARTING HOT ENGINE.= IF ENGINE HAS BEEN SHUT OFF FOR ONLY A
BRIEF PERIOD AND IS NEAR NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE, IT IS NOT
NECESSARY TO USE CARBURETOR CHOKE LEVER. WITH SOME ENGINES, DEPENDING
UPON CARBURETOR CONDITION AND ADJUSTMENT, HOT STARTING IS EASIER AND
MORE DEPENDABLE IF FOOT STARTER CRANK IS OPERATED ONE STROKE BEFORE
TURNING IGNITION SWITCH ON.

(1) CLOSE THROTTLE GRIP BY TURNING FULLY OUTWARD.

(2) TURN IGNITION SWITCH ON.

(3) OPERATE FOOT STARTER CRANK TO START ENGINE.

(4) WHEN HOT ENGINE DOES NOT START READILY AFTER TWO OR THREE STROKES
OF THE FOOT STARTER CRANK, IT IS USUALLY DUE TO AN OVERRICH (FLOODED)
CONDITION, AND THE PROPER PROCEDURE THEN IS TO OPEN THROTTLE WIDE SO
THAT MORE AIR CAN ENTER: CLOSE THROTTLE QUICKLY AFTER ENGINE STARTS.
CAUTION: AFTER ENGINE HAS WARMED UP TO A NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE,
DO NOT ALLOW ENGINE TO STAND IDLING FOR LONGER THAN A 1 MINUTE
INTERVAL.

=E. STARTING ENGINE WITH DEAD BATTERY.= SEE PARAGRAPH 12.

=F. BEHAVIOR OF INSTRUMENT PANEL SIGNAL LIGHTS.= FUNCTION OF
GENERATOR (GREEN) SIGNAL LIGHT DEPENDS UPON ACTION OF CUTOUT
RELAY; ENGINE OIL PRESSURE (RED) SIGNAL LIGHT DEPENDS UPON ACTION
OF OIL FEED PUMP. RIDER MUST, THEREFORE, THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND
OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH SIGNAL LIGHTS TO JUDGE CONDITION OF
GENERATORBATTERY CIRCUIT AND PRESSURE IN ENGINE OIL CIRCULATING SYSTEM.

(1) WHEN IGNITION LIGHT SWITCH IS TURNED TO FIRST (RIGHT) POSITION,
PREPARATORY TO STARTING ENGINE, BOTH GREEN AND RED SIGNAL LIGHTS SHOULD
GO ON. CAUTION: WHEN SWITCH IS TURNED ON, IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENGINE HAS
BEEN PRIMED BY CRANKING, RED (OIL PRESSURE) SIGNAL LIGHT MAY NOT LIGHT
AT ONCE, BUT WILL LIGHT AFTER A FEW SECONDS, DUE TO OIL PRESSURE BUILT
UP BY CRANKING, AND IS MOST LIKELY TO BE NOTICED IN COLD WEATHER.

(2) WITH ENGINE STARTED AND RUNNING AT MEDIUM IDLING SPEED, BOTH SIGNAL
LIGHTS SHOULD GO OFF. CAUTION: SHOULD OIL PRESSURE (RED) SIGNAL LIGHT
FAIL TO GO OFF AT SPEEDS ABOVE IDLING, CONDITIONS MUST BE BROUGHT TO
ATTENTION OF UNIT MECHANIC.

(3) AT SLOW IDLE SPEED, OR UNDER APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES PER HOUR ROAD
SPEED (IN HIGH GEAR), GENERATOR (GREEN) SIGNAL LIGHT WILL NORMALLY
FLASH ON AND OFF, BECAUSE AT THAT SPEED GENERATOR VOLTAGE OUTPUT IS
VERY LOW AND UNSTEADY. CAUTION: SHOULD GENERATOR (GREEN) SIGNAL
LIGHT FAIL TO GO OFF AT SPEED ABOVE APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES PER HOUR,
GENERATOR IS EITHER NOT CHARGING AT ALL, OR ITS CURRENT OUTPUT IS NOT
UP TO NORMAL, AND GENERATOR SHOULD BE GIVEN ATTENTION AT ONCE.

8. STOPPING THE ENGINE.

=A.= STOP ENGINE ONLY BY TURNING IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH TO OFF
(STRAIGHTAHEAD) POSITION, TO PREVENT DISCHARGE OF BATTERY THROUGH
SPARK COIL PRIMARY CIRCUIT.

9. OPERATION OF VEHICLE.

=A. STARTING ON LEVEL GROUND.= THE ENGINE HAVING BEEN WARMED UP AND
CHECKED FOR SATISFACTORY OPERATION, THE VEHICLE (WITH OPERATOR IN
RIDING POSITION) IS PUT IN MOTION AS FOLLOWS:

(1) TRANSFER BODY WEIGHT TO RIGHT LEG.

(2) FOLD BACK SIDE STAND (JIFFY STAND).

(3) DISENGAGE CLUTCH BY DEPRESSING CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL WITH HEEL OF LEFT
FOOT.

(4) SHIFT GEAR SHIFTER LEVER INTO 1 (LOW) GEAR POSITION.

(5) SLOWLY ENGAGE CLUTCH BY DEPRESSING CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL WITH TOE OF
LEFT FOOT.

(6) WHEN CLUTCH STARTS TO TAKE HOLD, OPEN THROTTLE SUFFICIENTLY TO
MAINTAIN ENGINE SPEED.

(7) ACCELERATE GRADUALLY TO BETWEEN 12 AND 15 MILES PER HOUR IN LOW
GEAR.

(8) CLOSE THROTTLE QUICKLY.

(9) DISENGAGE CLUTCH.

(10) SHIFT THROUGH N (NEUTRAL) POSITION INTO 2 (SECOND) GEAR.

(11) REENGAGE CLUTCH AND ACCELERATE TO ABOUT 25 MILES PER HOUR.

(12) CLOSE THROTTLE QUICKLY.

(13) DISENGAGE CLUTCH.

(14) SHIFT INTO 3 (HIGH) GEAR.

(15) REENGAGE CLUTCH AND ACCELERATE TO DESIRED SPEED.

=B. STARTING ON UNEVEN OR SOFT GROUND.=

(1) IF STANDING ON AN INCLINE OR IN LOOSE, HEAVY GROUND, MORE ENGINE
POWER WILL BE REQUIRED TO START VEHICLE WITHOUT STALLING ENGINE.

(2) IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO KEEP VEHICLE FROM ROLLING BY KEEPING
PRESSURE ON FRONT BRAKE HAND LEVER. BRAKE PRESSURE IS RELEASED AFTER
VEHICLE STARTS IN FORWARD MOTION.

(3) OPEN THROTTLE AND ENGAGE CLUTCH AT SAME TIME TO PROVIDE POWER
NEEDED FOR STARTING, WITHOUT RACING ENGINE UNNECESSARILY.

(4) MOTORCYCLE STARTS SHOULD BE MADE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE APPLICATION OF
POWER, WITH CONSEQUENT UNNECESSARY SPINNING OF REAR WHEEL.

10. DRIVING PRECAUTIONS.

=A.= PRACTICE WILL ENABLE A RIDER TO JUDGE AT WHAT RATE OF SPEED THE
MOTORCYCLE SHOULD BE MOVING BEFORE HE SHIFTS FROM A LOWER TO HIGHER
GEAR, AND ENGINE SHOULD NEVER BE PERMITTED TO LABOR UNDULY, WHEN A
SHIFT OF GEARS, HIGHER TO LOWER, WOULD IMPROVE OPERATION.

(1) OPERATOR MUST NOT LOOK DOWN AT GEAR SHIFTER WHEN SHIFTING GEARS,
BUT KEEP HIS EYES ON THE ROAD AHEAD. DO NOT RIDE THE CLUTCH. THE
OPERATORS FOOT SHOULD REST ON CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL ONLY WHEN HE IS
OPERATING IT. WHEN SHIFTING GEARS, DISENGAGE CLUTCH FULLY TO AVOID GEAR
DAMAGE AND SHIFTING DIFFICULTIES. CAUTION: MANY TRANSMISSIONS ARE
RUINED THROUGH FAILURE TO DISENGAGE CLUTCH FULLY WHEN SHIFTING GEARS.

=B. BRAKING.= REAR WHEEL SERVICE BRAKE MUST BE IN SUCH CONDITION THAT
MEDIUMHARD APPLICATION WILL CAUSE REAR WHEEL TO LOCK. APPLICATION OF
SERVICE BRAKE SHOULD BE GRADUAL, WITH JUST ENOUGH FORCE TO ACCOMPLISH
DESIRED RESULT.

(1) AUXILIARY FRONT WHEEL BRAKE, WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SERVICE
BRAKE, MUST BE APPLIED WITH CAUTION, ESPECIALLY ON WET, MUDDY, OR
SLIPPERY ROADS.

(2) AFTER PASSING THROUGH WATER, THE BRAKES SHOULD BE SET SLIGHTLY, AND
THE VEHICLE OPERATED FOR A SHORT DISTANCE, UNTIL SUFFICIENT HEAT HAS
BEEN GENERATED TO DRY THE BRAKES.

=C. AVOID LOW GEAR OPERATION.= ALWAYS OPERATE VEHICLE IN HIGHEST GEAR
POSSIBLE, CONSISTENT WITH TACTICAL SITUATION, SPEED REQUIRED, POWER
REQUIRED, AND KIND AND NATURE OF ROAD SUBSTANCE, TO PREVENT OVERHEATING
OF ENGINE.

=D. HIGH SPEED TIPS.= ONLY EXPERIENCED RIDERS SHOULD INDULGE IN
HIGHSPEED RIDING. A MOTORCYCLE OPERATED FOR LONG DISTANCES AT HIGH
SPEED MUST BE GIVEN CLOSER THAN ORDINARY ATTENTION TO AVOID SERIOUS
ENGINE OVERHEATING WITH CONSEQUENT DAMAGE. FOR BETTER MOTORCYCLE
SERVICE, APPLY THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS:

(1) DEVELOP HABIT OF FREQUENTLY SNAPPING THROTTLE SHUT FOR AN INSTANT
WHEN RUNNING AT HIGH SPEED. THIS DRAWS ADDITIONAL LUBRICATION TO PISTON
AND CYLINDER AND ASSISTS IN COOLING ENGINE.

(2) IN COOL WEATHER, OPERATE ENGINE SLOWLY UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY
WARMED UP, TO AVOID DAMAGE TO PISTONS, RINGS, CYLINDERS, AND OTHER
PARTS BEFORE OIL IS WARM ENOUGH TO CIRCULATE FREELY.

(3) IF HANDLE BAR WINDSHIELD AND LEG SHIELDS ARE USED, ENGINE IS
MORE LIKELY TO OVERHEAT WITH CONTINUED HIGHSPEED RIDING. WATCH THIS
CAREFULLY.

(4) ADJUST STEERING DAMPER FOR BEST CONTROL OF MOTORCYCLE CONSISTENT
WITH RIDING SPEED AND CONDITION AND NATURE OF ROAD.

11. STOPPING AND PARKING VEHICLE.

=A. STOPPING VEHICLE.= RIDER WILL MAKE A RESTART EASIER AND QUICKER
IF HE WILL APPLY THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS UPON STOPPING VEHICLE:

(1) CLOSE THROTTLE.

(2) DISENGAGE CLUTCH.

(3) APPLY BRAKE (OR BRAKES) TO SLOW VEHICLE WITHOUT SLIDING REAR TIRE.

(4) JUST BEFORE COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP, SHIFT INTO N (NEUTRAL)
POSITION AND ENGAGE CLUTCH. CAUTION: IF IMMEDIATE RESTART IS TO BE
MADE, SHIFT INTO 1 (LOW) GEAR AND ALLOW CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL TO REMAIN
IN DISENGAGED POSITION. (RIDER WILL BE MOUNTED ON MOTORCYCLE WITH
ENGINE RUNNING.)

(5) CONTINUE BRAKE APPLICATION TO COMPLETE STOP.

(6) AFTER VEHICLE SLOWS TO POINT WHERE IT CAN NO LONGER BE BALANCED BY
STEERING, PLACE LEFT FOOT ON GROUND TO MAINTAIN BALANCE UNTIL RIGHT
FOOT CAN BE REMOVED FROM BRAKE OPERATING PEDAL. CAUTION: DO NOT IDLE
ENGINE LONGER THAN 1 MINUTE.

(7) STOP ENGINE BY TURNING IGNITION SWITCH OFF.

=B. PARKING VEHICLE.=

(1) LEAN MOTORCYCLE ON SIDE (JIFFY) STAND.

(2) SHIFT INTO 1 (LOW) GEAR.

(3) ENGAGE CLUTCH SO VEHICLE CANNOT ROLL.

(4) SHUT OFF GASOLINE SUPPLY BY TURNING VALVE (TO RIGHT) FINGERTIGHT
AGAINST ITS SEAT.

12. TOWING VEHICLE TO START ENGINE.

=A.= IN EMERGENCIES WHEN ENGINE CANNOT BE STARTED WITH FOOT STARTER
CRANK, IT CAN BE STARTED BY TOWING THE MOTORCYCLE.

(1) SET GEAR SHIFTER LEVER IN 2 (SECOND) GEAR POSITION.

(2) DISENGAGE CLUTCH.

(3) CHOKE CARBURETOR.

(4) TURN IGNITION SWITCH ON.

(5) AFTER MOMENTUM OF THE TOWED MOTORCYCLE REACHES BETWEEN 10 AND 15
MILES PER HOUR, ENGAGE CLUTCH, AND CONTINUE PROCEDURE UNTIL ENGINE
STARTS.

=B. ENGINE STARTING WITH DEAD BATTERY.= EMERGENCY ENGINE STARTING
WITH DEAD BATTERY CAN BE EFFECTED BY MAKING USE OF FRESHLY CHARGED
BATTERY, OR BY TOWING AS OUTLINED ABOVE. IF VEHICLE WITH DEAD BATTERY
IS TO BE TOWED FOR ENGINE STARTING, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

(1) DISCONNECT BATTERY NEGATIVE WIRE FROM GROUND ON RIGHT SIDE OF
MOTORCYCLE.

(2) TOW MOTORCYCLE FOR ENGINE STARTING.

(3) AFTER ENGINE IS STARTED, RECONNECT BATTERY GROUND WIRE TO FRAME TO
PREVENT DAMAGE TO ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

13. RUNNINGIN NEW ENGINE (OR VEHICLE).

=A.= A NEW MOTORCYCLE ENGINE OR NEWLY OVERHAULED ENGINE MUST BE GIVEN
PROPER BREAKIN CONSIDERATION FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST 1,000 TO 1,200
MILES OF SERVICE. FAILURE TO DO THIS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE THAT WILL PUT
ENGINE OUT OF ACTIVE SERVICE WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

=B.= AT THE FIRST 250 MILES, CHECK FRONT AND REAR DRIVE CHAINS TO MAKE
SURE THEY ARE RECEIVING REQUIRED AMOUNT OF OIL FOR AMPLE LUBRICATION.
IF NECESSARY, HAVE CHAIN OILERS ADJUSTED BY UNIT MECHANIC. DRIVE CHAINS
MUST BE INSPECTED FOR CORRECT ADJUSTMENT, AND BE GIVEN ATTENTION BY
UNIT MECHANIC AS NEEDED.

=C.= AT FIRST 500 MILES, DRAIN OIL TANK AND REFILL WITH FRESH OIL.
CHECK FRONT AND REAR CHAINS (STEP B ABOVE). THEREAFTER, FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS IN MAINTENANCE OPERATION SECTION.

=D.= AFTER A NEW MOTORCYCLE HAS BEEN RUN 500 TO 1,000 MILES IT NEEDS
TO BE THOROUGHLY CHECKED OVER AND ANY LOOSE SCREWS AND NUTS TIGHTENED.
PARTICULAR ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTING
BOLTS AND NUTS, AND TO REAR WHEEL MOUNTING SOCKET SCREWS.

=E.= FOLLOWING POINTERS MUST BE OBSERVED WHEN RUNNINGIN NEW ENGINE OR
NEWLY OVERHAULED ENGINE:

(1) DO NOT EXCEED 30 MILES PER HOUR DURING FIRST 100 MILES.

(2) DO NOT EXCEED 35 MILES PER HOUR DURING NEXT 200 MILES.

(3) DO NOT EXCEED 40 MILES PER HOUR DURING NEXT 400 MILES.

(4) DO NOT EXCEED 50 MILES PER HOUR DURING NEXT 500 MILES.

(5) AVOID USE OF LOW GEARS DURING BREAKIN OPERATION AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.

14. PURPOSE.

=A.= TO INSURE MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE VEHICLE
BE SYSTEMATICALLY INSPECTED AT INTERVALS EACH DAY IT IS OPERATED AND
WEEKLY, SO THAT DEFECTS MAY BE DISCOVERED AND CORRECTED BEFORE THEY
RESULT IN SERIOUS DAMAGE OR FAILURE. CERTAIN SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE
SERVICES WILL BE PERFORMED AT THESE DESIGNATED INTERVALS. THE SERVICES
SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE PERFORMED BY DRIVER OR CREW BEFORE
OPERATION, DURING OPERATION, AT HALT, AFTER OPERATION, AND WEEKLY.

=B.= DRIVER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES ARE LISTED ON THE BACK OF
DRIVERS TRIP TICKET AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICE RECORD, W.D.
FORM NO. 48, TO COVER VEHICLES OF ALL TYPES AND MODELS. ITEMS PECULIAR
TO SPECIFIC VEHICLES, BUT NOT LISTED ON W.D. FORM NO. 48, ARE COVERED
IN MANUAL PROCEDURES UNDER THE ITEMS TO WHICH THEY ARE RELATED. CERTAIN
ITEMS LISTED ON THE FORM THAT DO NOT PERTAIN TO THE VEHICLE INVOLVED
ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE PROCEDURES AS WRITTEN INTO THE MANUAL. EVERY
ORGANIZATION MUST THOROUGHLY SCHOOL EACH DRIVER IN PERFORMING THE
MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN MANUALS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE
LISTED SPECIFICALLY ON W.D. FORM NO. 48.

=C.= THE ITEMS LISTED ON W.D. FORM NO. 48 THAT APPLY TO THIS VEHICLE
ARE EXPANDED IN THIS MANUAL TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE INSPECTIONS AND SERVICES. THESE SERVICES ARE
ARRANGED TO FACILITATE INSPECTION AND CONSERVE THE TIME OF THE DRIVER,
AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME NUMERICAL ORDER AS SHOWN ON W.D.
FORM NO. 48. THE ITEM NUMBERS, HOWEVER, ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE SHOWN
ON THAT FORM.

=D.= THE GENERAL INSPECTION OF EACH ITEM APPLIES ALSO TO ANY SUPPORTING
MEMBER OR CONNECTION, AND GENERALLY INCLUDES A CHECK TO SEE WHETHER THE
ITEM IS IN GOOD CONDITION, CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED, SECURE, OR EXCESSIVELY
WORN.

(1) THE INSPECTION FOR GOOD CONDITION IS USUALLY AN EXTERNAL VISUAL

 PARAGRAPH
 INTRODUCTION 19
 LUBRICATION GUIDE 20

19. INTRODUCTION.

=A.= LUBRICATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE,
DETERMINING TO A GREAT EXTENT SERVICEABILITY OF PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES.

=20. LUBRICATION GUIDE= (FIG. 10).

=A. GENERAL.= LUBRICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS MATERIEL ARE
CONSOLIDATED IN A LUBRICATION GUIDE (FIG. 10). THESE SPECIFY THE POINTS
TO BE LUBRICATED, THE PERIODS OF LUBRICATION, AND THE LUBRICANT TO BE
USED. INTERVALS INDICATED ON THE GUIDE ARE FOR NORMAL SERVICE. FOR
EXTREME CONDITIONS, HIGH SPEED, HEAT, MUD, SNOW, ROUGH ROADS, DUST,
ETC., CHANGE ENGINE OIL AND LUBRICATE MORE FREQUENTLY. IN ADDITION TO
THE ITEMS ON THE GUIDE, BRAKE, GEAR SHIFTER, CLUTCH CONTROL LINKAGE,
AND HINGES MUST BE LUBRICATED AT FREQUENT INTERVALS.

=B. SUPPLIES.= IN THE FIELD IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SUPPLY A
COMPLETE ASSORTMENT OF LUBRICANTS CALLED FOR BY THE LUBRICATION GUIDE
TO MEET THE RECOMMENDATIONS. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO MAKE THE BEST USE
OF THOSE AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO INSPECTION BY THE OFFICER CONCERNED, IN
CONSULTATION WITH RESPONSIBLE ORDNANCE PERSONNEL.

=C. LUBRICATION NOTES.= THE FOLLOWING NOTES APPLY TO THE LUBRICATION
GUIDE (FIG. 10). ALL NOTE REFERENCES IN THE GUIDE ITSELF ARE TO THE
STEPS BELOW HAVING THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER:

(1) BRAKE FITTINGS. EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN LUBRICATING BRAKE OPERATING
CAMS AND FRONT BRAKE COVER BUSHING, AS EXCESS GREASE WORKING OUT OF
THESE BEARINGS IS LIKELY TO GET ONTO BRAKE LINING, REDUCING BRAKE
EFFICIENCY. CAUTION: WHEN USING AIROPERATED GREASE GUN, MAKE SURE NOT
TO OVERLUBRICATE BRAKE FITTINGS.

(2) BRAKE HAND LEVER OILCAN POINTS. OIL HAND LEVER FITTINGS AND OILER
MOUNTED ON CABLE HOUSING. OIL FRONT BRAKE CONTROL CABLE AT ENDS OF
CONTROL CABLE HOUSING.

(3) GENERATOR COMMUTATOR END BEARING. HANDPACK WITH GENERAL PURPOSE
GREASE, NO. 2, AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE ZERO. BELOW ZERO, USE LIGHTER
GREASE. THIS OPERATION REQUIRES REMOVAL OF GENERATOR END COVER. BEARING
OUTER GREASE RETAINER MUST BE LOOSENED AND SWUNG ASIDE FOR ACCESS TO
BEARING. IF NOT CONVENIENT TO GREASE BEARING AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, AT
LEAST LUBRICATE WITH A FEW DROPS OF ENGINE OIL APPLIED TO HOLE IN OUTER
GREASE RETAINER. DO NOT OVERLUBRICATE. CAUTION: GENERATOR REGULATING
BRUSH PLATE MUST NOT BE SHIFTED WHILE BEARING OUTER GREASE RETAINER
IS LOOSE (PAR. 92). GENERATOR DRIVE END BEARING REQUIRES NO ATTENTION,
SINCE IT IS LUBRICATED BY OIL CIRCULATING THROUGH ENGINE.

(4) SPARK AND THROTTLE CONTROL GRIPS. THESE GRIPS REQUIRE DISASSEMBLY.
TWICE A YEAR, OR WHENEVER GRIPS DO NOT TURN FREELY, INDICATING NEED OF
LUBRICATION, REMOVE GRIPS, CLEAN PARTS, APPLY GREASE, AND REASSEMBLE
(PAR. 101).

(5) AIR CLEANER. EXAMINE OIL CUP DAILY FOR EXCESSIVE DIRT AND CORRECT
OIL LEVEL. UNDER EXTREMELY DUSTY OR SANDY CONDITIONS IT MAY BE
NECESSARY TO CLEAN AND REFILL THE AIR CLEANER MORE THAN ONCE DAILY.
REFILL OIL CUP TO INDICATED LEVEL WITH ENGINE OIL. DRAIN, CLEAN, AND
REFILL OIL CUP EVERY 250 MILES, DEPENDING UPON OPERATING CONDITIONS.
EVERY 1,000 MILES (OFTENER IF NECESSARY), REMOVE AIR CLEANER FILTER
UNITS, WASH IN DRYCLEANING SOLVENT, LUBRICATE, AND REASSEMBLE (PAR.
76). NOTE: EARLY TYPE ROUND CLEANER DID NOT HAVE REMOVABLE FILTER
ELEMENT. COMPLETE CLEANER MUST BE REMOVED TO WASH ELEMENT.

(6) WHEEL BEARINGS. WHEN WHEEL HUBS ARE LUBRICATED AT REGULAR 500MILE
INTERVAL, 1/8 OUNCE OF GREASE WITH EACH GREASING IS SUFFICIENT. THIS
AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 15 SHOTS OF THE STANDARD 1POUND AIR GUN, OR FOUR
STROKES WITH A 1POUND, HANDOPERATED GUN. IF VEHICLE HAS BEEN OPERATED
IN WATER, WHEEL HUBS SUBMERGED, APPLY HUB GREASING SERVICE IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARD (OR SOON AS SITUATION PERMITS). DO NOT OVERLUBRICATE WHEEL
HUB BEARINGS, AS EXCESS GREASE MAY WORK INTO BRAKE LININGS, REDUCING
BRAKE EFFICIENCY. WHEN USING AIROPERATED GREASE GUN, IT IS EASY TO
OVERLUBRICATE WHEEL HUB BEARINGS.

(7) STEERING HEAD BEARINGS. EVERY 50,000 MILES, REPACK UPPER AND LOWER
BEARINGS, OR WHENEVER THERE IS OCCASION TO REMOVE RIGID FORK FOR REPAIR
OR REPLACEMENT (PAR. 98).

EMPTY TANK HOLDS 1 U. S. GALLON. CHECK DAILY AND ADD ENGINE OIL AS
NECESSARY TO REFILL TANK WITHIN 1 INCH OF TOP. OIL LEVEL GAGE ROD (DIP
STICK) IS LOCATED DIRECTLY BELOW TANK CAP. WHEN OIL LEVEL IS DOWN TO
REFILL MARK ON GAGE ROD, 2 U. S. QUARTS MAY BE ADDED. DRAIN OIL TANK
EVERY 1,000 MILES AND REFILL WITH FRESH ENGINE OIL. DRAIN PLUG LOCATED
ON UNDERSIDE OF TANK IN FORWARD POSITION. IN EXTREMELY DUSTY SERVICE,
AND IN WINTER WEATHER, CHANGE OIL OFTENER.

(A) WINTER CAUTION. WATER IS A BYPRODUCT OF COMBUSTION IN ANY
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. IN A CONDENSED STATE, THE WATER VAPOR
FORMED WOULD EQUAL APPROXIMATELY THE QUANTITY OF GASOLINE BURNED. SOME
OF THIS WATER VAPOR ESCAPES PAST THE RINGS INTO THE CRANKCASE. WHEN
STARTING AND WARMING UP IN COLD WEATHER, CONSIDERABLE VAPOR GETTING
INTO CRANKCASE CONDENSES TO WATER BEFORE CRANKCASE IS HOT ENOUGH
TO EXHAUST THE VAPOR, WITHOUT INSIDE CONDENSATION, THROUGH OUTSIDE
BREATHER. IF ENGINE IS DRIVEN ENOUGH TO GET CRANKCASE THOROUGHLY WARMED
UP FREQUENTLY, MOST OF THIS WATER IS AGAIN VAPORIZED AND BLOWN OUT
THROUGH OUTSIDE BREATHER. HOWEVER, A MODERATELY DRIVEN ENGINE, MAKING
ONLY SHORT RUNS NOW AND THEN, AND SELDOM THOROUGHLY WARMED UP, IS
LIKELY TO ACCUMULATE AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF WATER IN OIL TANK. THIS
WATER WILL, IN FREEZING WEATHER, BECOME SLUSH OR ICE AND, IF ALLOWED
TO ACCUMULATE TOO LONG, MAY BLOCK OIL LINES WITH RESULTING DAMAGE TO
ENGINE. ALSO, WATER MIXED WITH OIL FOR SOME TIME, FORMS A HEAVY SLUDGE
OF CONSIDERABLE ACID CONTENT THAT IS VERY HARMFUL TO BEARINGS AND
OTHER INTERNAL ENGINE PARTS. TO SUM IT UP BRIEFLY, AN ENGINE THAT IS
USED ONLY FOR SHORT RUNS DURING FREEZING WEATHER REQUIRES FREQUENT OIL
CHANGES ALONG WITH THOROUGH FLUSHING OF TANK TO REMOVE ANY ACCUMULATED
SLUDGE.

(9) TRANSMISSION FILLER OPENING. CHECK OIL LEVEL IN TRANSMISSION CASE
EVERY 250 MILES AND ADD ENGINE OIL AS NECESSARY TO BRING LEVEL UP TO
FILLER OPENING. IF MOTORCYCLE IS RUN UNUSUALLY LONG DISTANCES, INSPECT
MORE FREQUENTLY. MOTORCYCLE MUST BE ON REAR STAND IN STRAIGHT UPRIGHT
POSITION WHEN CHECKING OIL LEVEL OR FILLING TRANSMISSION CASE. USE
SAME GRADE OF OIL USED IN ENGINE, SUMMER, AND WINTER. IF GEAR SHIFTING
DIFFICULTY IS CAUSED BY OIL CONGEALING IN EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER, THIN
OIL WITH SMALL AMOUNT OF KEROSENE OR DRYCLEANING SOLVENT. EVERY 1,000
MILES, DRAIN AND REFILL TRANSMISSION TO LEVEL OF TRANSMISSION FILLER
PLUG OPENING WITH SPECIFIED GRADE OF ENGINE OIL. TRANSMISSION HOLDS
3/4 PINT OF OIL. TO DRAIN TRANSMISSION CASE REMOVE FILLER PLUG AND LAY
MOTORCYCLE ON RIGHT SIDE. CAUTION: DO NOT LEAVE MOTORCYCLE ON SIDE
LONGER THAN TWO MINUTES.

(10) DRIVE CHAINS.

(A) FRONT AND REAR DRIVE CHAINS ARE AUTOMATICALLY SUPPLIED WITH
LUBRICATION BY ENGINE OIL PUMPS. CHAIN OILERS ARE ADJUSTABLE AND MAY
NEED OCCASIONAL READJUSTMENT TO MEET LUBRICATION REQUIREMENTS OF VARIED
OPERATING CONDITIONS. EVERY 1,000 MILES (OR MORE OFTEN IF OPERATING
CONDITIONS ARE EXTREMELY SEVERE) INSPECT FRONT PRIMARY DRIVE CHAIN FOR
ADEQUATE LUBRICATION (FIG. 36).

(B) AT EVERY 1,000MILE PERIOD REAR DRIVE CHAIN SHOULD HAVE
ADDITIONAL LUBRICATION AS FOLLOWS: REMOVE CHAIN, WASH THOROUGHLY IN
DRYCLEANING SOLVENT AND HANG IT UP TO DRY. THEN SOAK CHAIN IN SAE 10
ENGINE OIL FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW OIL TO PENETRATE INTO
ALL CHAIN BEARINGS. DRAIN CHAIN AND WIPE OFF EXCESS OIL. INSTALL REAR
CHAIN (PAR. 63). (THIS ATTENTION IS NOT REQUIRED BY FRONT CHAIN.)
READJUSTMENT OF CHAIN OILERS MUST BE MADE ONLY BY ORGANIZATION MECHANIC
(PAR. 61). CAUTION: INSPECT FREQUENTLY AND MAKE SURE THAT REAR CHAIN
OILER SUPPLY PIPE IS CLEAR, NOT BENT OR DAMAGED.

=D. BEFORE APPLYING LUBRICANT.= ALWAYS WIPE DIRT FROM THE LUBRICATION
FITTINGS OR PLUGS SO THAT DIRT WILL NOT ENTER WITH THE LUBRICANT.
LUBRICATE ALL CHASSIS POINTS AFTER WASHING VEHICLE OR AFTER VEHICLE HAS
BEEN OPERATED IN STREAMS OR EXTREMELY MUDDY OR SLUSHY ROADS. CAUTION:
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT HIGHPRESSURE CLEANING STREAMS OR
STEAM SHOULD NOT BE DIRECTED AGAINST ENDS OF WHEEL HUBS, BRAKE SIDE
COVER BEARINGS, AIR CLEANER, HANDLE BAR GRIPS, OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.
TO DO SO WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT CORRECT LUBRICATION AND FUNCTIONING OF
THESE PARTS.

=E. OILCAN POINTS.= ALL BRAKE, TRANSMISSION, AND CLUTCH CONTROL
POINTS NOT FITTED WITH GREASE CONNECTIONS SHOULD BE LUBRICATED WITH
ENGINE OIL. FRONT BRAKE CONTROL CABLE, SPARK, AND THROTTLE CONTROL
WIRES MUST BE OILED AT THE ENDS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSINGS,
ESPECIALLY AFTER WASHING VEHICLE, OR AFTER OPERATING IT IN WET WEATHER.
KEEP BATTERY TERMINAL FELT WASHERS SATURATED WITH ENGINE OIL TO PREVENT
CORROSION OF CONNECTIONS.

=F. WARNING LIGHT.= ACTION OF THE ENGINE OIL FEED PUMP IS INDICATED
BY RED SIGNAL LIGHT IN INSTRUMENT PANEL. RIDER MUST BE THOROUGHLY
FAMILIAR WITH OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS SIGNAL LIGHT, TO JUDGE
CONDITION OF ENGINE OIL CIRCULATING SYSTEM (PAR. 7 F).

SECTION VIII

SECOND ECHELON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

 PARAGRAPH
 SECOND ECHELON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES 26

26. SECOND ECHELON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES.

=A.= REGULAR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS AND SERVICES ARE
A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE FUNCTION OF THE USING ARMS, AND ARE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF COMMANDERS OF OPERATING ORGANIZATIONS.

(1) FREQUENCY. THE FREQUENCIES OF THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES
OUTLINED HEREIN ARE CONSIDERED A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR NORMAL
OPERATION OF VEHICLES. UNDER UNUSUAL OPERATING CONDITIONS SUCH AS
EXTREME TEMPERATURES, AND DUSTY OR SANDY TERRAIN, IT MAY BE NECESSARY
TO PERFORM CERTAIN MAINTENANCE SERVICES MORE FREQUENTLY.

(2) FIRST ECHELON PARTICIPATION. THE DRIVERS SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEIR
VEHICLES AND ASSIST THE MECHANICS WHILE PERIODIC SECOND ECHELON
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. ORDINARILY THE DRIVER
SHOULD PRESENT THE VEHICLE FOR A SCHEDULED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
SERVICE IN A REASONABLY CLEAN CONDITION; THAT IS, IT SHOULD BE DRY,
AND NOT CAKED WITH MUD OR GREASE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT INSPECTION AND
SERVICING WILL BE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED. HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE SHOULD NOT
BE WASHED OR WIPED THOROUGHLY CLEAN, SINCE CERTAIN TYPES OF DEFECTS,
SUCH AS CRACKS, LEAKS, AND LOOSE OR SHIFTED PARTS OR ASSEMBLIES ARE
MORE EVIDENT IF THE SURFACES ARE SLIGHTLY SOILED OR DUSTY.

(3) IF INSTRUCTIONS OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE GENERAL
PROCEDURES IN PARAGRAPH (4) OR THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES IN PARAGRAPH (5)
WHICH FOLLOW, ARE REQUIRED FOR THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF A PREVENTIVE
MAINTENANCE SERVICE, OR FOR CORRECTION OF A DEFICIENCY, OTHER SECTIONS
OF THE VEHICLE OPERATORS MANUAL PERTAINING TO THE ITEM INVOLVED, OR A
DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL IN AUTHORITY, SHOULD BE CONSULTED.

(4) GENERAL PROCEDURES. THESE GENERAL PROCEDURES ARE BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
WHICH ARE TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN PERFORMING THE SERVICES ON THE ITEMS
LISTED IN THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES. THE SECOND ECHELON PERSONNEL MUST
BE THOROUGHLY TRAINED IN THESE PROCEDURES SO THAT THEY WILL APPLY THEM
AUTOMATICALLY.

(A) WHEN NEW OR OVERHAULED SUBASSEMBLIES ARE INSTALLED TO CORRECT
DEFICIENCIES, CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO SEE THAT THEY ARE CLEAN,
CORRECTLY INSTALLED, PROPERLY LUBRICATED, AND ADJUSTED.

(B) WHEN INSTALLING NEW LUBRICANT RETAINER SEALS, A COATING OF THE
LUBRICANT SHOULD BE WIPED OVER THE SEALING SURFACE OF THE LIP OF THE
SEAL.

(C) THE GENERAL INSPECTION OF EACH ITEM APPLIES ALSO TO ANY
SUPPORTING MEMBER OR CONNECTION, AND USUALLY INCLUDES A CHECK TO SEE
WHETHER THE ITEM IS IN GOOD CONDITION, CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED, SECURE,
OR EXCESSIVELY WORN. THE MECHANICS MUST BE THOROUGHLY TRAINED IN THE
FOLLOWING EXPLANATIONS OF THESE TERMS:

1. THE INSPECTION FOR GOOD CONDITION IS USUALLY AN EXTERNAL VISUAL
INSPECTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE UNIT IS DAMAGED BEYOND SAFE
OR SERVICEABLE LIMITS. THE TERM GOOD CONDITION IS EXPLAINED FURTHER
BY THE FOLLOWING: NOT BENT OR TWISTED, NOT CHAFED OR BURNED, NOT BROKEN
OR CRACKED, NOT BARE OR FRAYED, NOT DENTED OR COLLAPSED, NOT TORN OR
CUT.

2. THE INSPECTION OF A UNIT TO SEE THAT IT IS CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED
IS USUALLY AN EXTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS IN
ITS NORMAL ASSEMBLED POSITION IN THE VEHICLE.

3. THE INSPECTION OF A UNIT TO DETERMINE IF IT IS SECURE IS USUALLY
AN EXTERNAL VISUAL EXAMINATION, A HANDFEEL, OR A PRYBAR CHECK FOR
LOOSENESS; SUCH AN INSPECTION SHOULD INCLUDE ANY BRACKETS, LOCK
WASHERS, LOCK NUTS, LOCKING WIRES, OR COTTER PINS USED IN ASSEMBLY.

4. EXCESSIVELY WORN WILL BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN WORN, CLOSE TO OR
BEYOND SERVICEABLE LIMITS, AND LIKELY TO RESULT IN A FAILURE IF NOT
REPLACED BEFORE THE NEXT SCHEDULED INSPECTION.

(D) SPECIAL SERVICES. THESE ARE INDICATED BY REPEATING THE ITEM
NUMBERS IN THE COLUMNS WHICH SHOW THE INTERVAL AT WHICH THE SERVICES
ARE TO BE PERFORMED, AND SHOW THAT THE PARTS, OR ASSEMBLIES, ARE TO
RECEIVE CERTAIN MANDATORY SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, AN ITEM NUMBER IN
ONE OR BOTH COLUMNS OPPOSITE A TIGHTEN PROCEDURE, MEANS THAT THE
ACTUAL TIGHTENING OF THE OBJECT MUST BE PERFORMED. THE SPECIAL SERVICES
INCLUDE:

1. ADJUST. MAKE ALL NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PERTINENT SECTION OF THE VEHICLE OPERATORS MANUAL, SPECIAL BULLETINS,
OR OTHER CURRENT DIRECTIVES.

2. CLEAN. CLEAN UNITS OF THE VEHICLE WITH DRYCLEANING SOLVENT TO
REMOVE EXCESS LUBRICANT, DIRT, AND OTHER FOREIGN MATERIAL. AFTER THE
PARTS ARE CLEANED, RINSE THEM IN CLEAN DRYCLEANING SOLVENT, AND DRY
THEM THOROUGHLY. TAKE CARE TO KEEP THE PARTS CLEAN UNTIL REASSEMBLED,
AND BE CERTAIN TO KEEP DRYCLEANING SOLVENT AWAY FROM RUBBER OR OTHER
MATERIAL WHICH IT WILL DAMAGE. CLEAN THE PROTECTIVE GREASE COATING FROM
NEW PARTS, SINCE THIS MATERIAL IS NOT A GOOD LUBRICANT.

3. SPECIAL LUBRICATION. THIS APPLIES BOTH TO LUBRICATION OPERATIONS
THAT DO NOT APPEAR ON THE VEHICLE LUBRICATION GUIDE, AND TO ITEMS
THAT DO APPEAR ON SUCH GUIDES, BUT SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN CONNECTION
WITH THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS, IF PARTS HAVE TO BE DISASSEMBLED FOR
INSPECTION OR SERVICE.

4. SERVE. THIS USUALLY CONSISTS OF PERFORMING SPECIAL OPERATIONS,
SUCH AS REPLENISHING BATTERY WATER, AND DRAINING AND REFILLING UNITS
WITH OIL.

5. TIGHTEN. ALL TIGHTENING OPERATIONS SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITH
SUFFICIENT WRENCHTORQUE (FORCE ON THE WRENCH HANDLE) TO TIGHTEN THE
NUT ACCORDING TO GOOD MECHANICAL PRACTICE. USE TORQUEINDICATING
WRENCH WHERE SPECIFIED. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN, AS THIS MAY STRIP THREADS,
OR CAUSE DISTORTION. TIGHTENING WILL ALWAYS BE UNDERSTOOD TO INCLUDE
THE CORRECT INSTALLATION OF LOCK WASHERS, LOCK NUTS, AND COTTER PINS
PROVIDED TO SECURE THE TIGHTENING.

(E) WHEN CONDITIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PERFORM THE COMPLETE
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AT ONE TIME, THESE CAN SOMETIMES BE
HANDLED IN SECTIONS, PLANNING TO COMPLETE ALL OPERATIONS WITHIN THE
TASK IF POSSIBLE. ALL AVAILABLE TIME AT HALTS AND IN BIVOUAC AREAS MUST
BE UTILIZED, IF NECESSARY, TO ASSURE THAT MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS ARE
COMPLETED. WHEN LIMITED BY THE TACTICAL SITUATION, ITEMS WITH SPECIAL
SERVICES IN THE COLUMNS SHOULD BE GIVEN FIRST CONSIDERATION.

(F) THE NUMBERS OF THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES THAT FOLLOW
ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OUTLINED ON W.D. AGO FORM NO. 463, WHICH
IS THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICE WORK SHEET FOR MOTORCYCLES.
CERTAIN ITEMS ON THE WORK SHEET THAT DO NOT APPLY TO THIS VEHICLE
ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROCEDURES IN THIS MANUAL. IN GENERAL, THE
NUMERICAL SEQUENCE OF ITEMS ON THE WORK SHEET IS FOLLOWED IN THE MANUAL
PROCEDURES, BUT IN SOME INSTANCES THERE IS DEVIATION FOR CONSERVATION
OF THE MECHANICS TIME AND EFFORT.

(5) SPECIFIC PROCEDURES. THE PROCEDURES FOR PERFORMING EACH ITEM IN THE
1,000MILE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING CHART.
EACH PAGE OF THE CHART HAS A COLUMN AT ITS LEFT EDGE CORRESPONDING TO
THE 1,000MILE MAINTENANCE.

ROAD TEST

[SIDENOTE: 1000 MILE MAINTENANCE]

NOTE: IF TACTICAL SITUATION DOES NOT PERMIT A FULL ROAD TEST, PERFORM
ITEMS 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, AND 14, WHICH REQUIRE SLIGHT OR NO
MOVEMENT OF THE VEHICLE. WHEN A ROAD TEST IS POSSIBLE, IT SHOULD BE FOR
PREFERABLY 5, AND NOT OVER 10 MILES.

[SIDENOTE: 1]

=BEFOREOPERATION INSPECTION.= PERFORM BEFOREOPERATION SERVICE LISTED
ON W.D. FORM NO. 418. DRIVERS TRIP TICKET AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
SERVICE RECORD (DESCRIBED IN PAR. 15), TO DETERMINE IF VEHICLE IS IN A
SATISFACTORY CONDITION TO MAKE THE ROAD TEST SAFELY.

[SIDENOTE: 2]

=EASE OF STARTING.= START ENGINE AND OBSERVE ACTION OF STARTER. NOTE IF
ENGINE RESPONDS READILY.

[SIDENOTE: 3]

=OIL CIRCULATION.= OIL CIRCULATION IS NORMALLY INDICATED BY OIL SIGNAL
LIGHT (RED LIGHT) IN INSTRUMENT PANEL BEING OUT. WHEN RED LIGHT IS ON,
OIL IS NOT CIRCULATING. OBSERVE FOR EXCESS SMOKE IN EXHAUST. CAUTION:
IF RED LIGHT FAILS TO GO OUT AFTER ENGINE HAS BEEN STARTED, STOP
ENGINE AT ONCE. REFER TO PARAGRAPH 30 FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES.

[SIDENOTE: 4]

=INSTRUMENTS.= OBSERVE INSTRUMENTS FOR PROPER OR NORMAL INDICATION AND
FUNCTIONING OF SYSTEM TO WHICH THEY APPLY.

SPEEDOMETER AND ODOMETER. SPEEDOMETER MUST INDICATE VEHICLE SPEED
WITHOUT EXCESSIVE NOISE OR FLUCTUATION; ODOMETER MUST RECORD TRIP AND
TOTAL MILEAGE. OIL PRESSURE SIGNAL LIGHT. NOTE WHETHER OIL SIGNAL LIGHT
(RED LIGHT) INDICATES CORRECTLY. AFTER IGNITION SWITCH IS TURNED ON,
AND BEFORE STARTING ENGINE, THE RED LIGHT SHOULD GO ON, INDICATING NO
OIL CIRCULATION. WHEN ENGINE IS STARTED, LIGHT SHOULD GO OUT.

GENERATOR SIGNAL LIGHT. WITH SWITCH ON, AND BEFORE STARTING ENGINE,
THE GREEN SIGNAL LIGHT SHOULD GO ON, INDICATING DISCHARGE OF BATTERY.
AFTER STARTING ENGINE, INCREASE ENGINE SPEED TO A MEDIUM FAST IDLE;
GREEN SIGNAL LIGHT SHOULD THEN GO OUT, INDICATING GENERATOR IS CHARGING
BATTERY. CAUTION: CONTINUE OBSERVATION OF SIGNAL LIGHTS DURING ROAD
TEST, AND IF LIGHTS SHOULD FAIL TO OPERATE AS INDICATED ABOVE, STOP
ENGINE, INVESTIGATE CAUSE, AND CORRECT OR REPORT TROUBLE TO PROPER
AUTHORITY.

[SIDENOTE: 5]

=BRAKE OPERATION.= TEST FOOT BRAKE FOR SAFE STOP WITHIN REASONABLE
DISTANCE. NOTE SQUEAKS OR CHATTER THAT MIGHT INDICATE WET, OILY,
DIRTY, OR LOOSE LINING, DAMAGED DRUM, OR IMPROPER ADJUSTMENT. APPLY
HANDOPERATED FRONT BRAKE ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH REAR BRAKE AND
OBSERVE WHETHER IT OPERATES EFFECTIVELY IN ASSISTING TO MAKE A QUICKER
STOP.

[SIDENOTE: 6]

=CLUTCH OPERATION.= BEFORE MOVING VEHICLE, MAKE SURE THAT CLUTCH PEDAL
HAS SATISFACTORY FREE TRAVEL BEFORE IT BEGINS TO DISENGAGE CLUTCH; THAT
IT RELEASES CLUTCH COMPLETELY BEFORE REACHING END OF TRAVEL; AND THAT
THERE ARE NO UNUSUAL NOISES IN CLUTCHRELEASE MECHANISM. WHEN STARTING
VEHICLE, OBSERVE WHETHER CLUTCH GRABS, CHATTERS, OR SLIPS WHEN FULLY
ENGAGED.

[SIDENOTE: 7]

=GEARSHIFT.= SHIFT THROUGH ENTIRE GEAR RANGE OF TRANSMISSION AND
OBSERVE WHETHER MECHANISM OPERATES FREELY WITHOUT CLASHING OR JUMPING
OUT OF GEAR. NOTE ANY UNUSUAL VIBRATION THAT MIGHT INDICATE LOOSE
ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION MOUNTINGS.

[SIDENOTE: 8]

=UNUSUAL NOISES.= DURING ENTIRE ROAD TEST, LISTEN FOR UNUSUAL NOISES
THAT MIGHT INDICATE WORN, LOOSE, DAMAGED, OR INSUFFICIENTLY LUBRICATED
PARTS IN THE ENTIRE MOTORCYCLE, PARTICULARLY IN ENGINE AND ACCESSORIES,
OR IN THE POWER TRAIN.

CAUTION: LOOSE PRIMARY (FRONT) DRIVE CHAIN, WITH SLACK IN EXCESS OF
1/2 INCH TOTAL UPANDDOWN MOTION, CAN CAUSE EXCESSIVE NOISE WHICH
SOUNDS LIKE ENGINE KNOCK. REMOVE INSPECTION COVER FOR EXAMINATION OF
CHAIN.

[SIDENOTE: 9]

=STEERING.= OBSERVE STEERING MECHANISM FOR INDICATION OF LOOSENESS
OR EXCESSIVE BINDING THROUGH FULL TURNING RANGE. WITH HANDS RESTING
LIGHTLY ON HANDLE BARS AND VEHICLE IN VERTICAL POSITION, OBSERVE
WHETHER THERE IS ANY TENDENCY TO PULL TO ONE SIDE WHEN OPERATING AT A
REASONABLE SPEED. NOTE ANY INDICATION OF STEERING INSTABILITY AT HIGHER
SPEEDS.

[SIDENOTE: 10]

=BALANCE.= IF VEHICLE DOES NOT BALANCE PROPERLY IN OPERATION, INSPECT
FOR MISALINEMENT OF REAR WHEEL.

=B. TESTS TO DETERMINE MECHANICAL CONDITION OF ENGINE.=

(1) RINGS AND VALVES. THIS IS A SIMPLE COMPRESSION TEST. IF POSSIBLE,
MAKE THIS TEST WITH THE ENGINE WARM. IGNITION SWITCH MUST BE OFF. CRANK
ENGINE SLOWLY, PLACING ENTIRE WEIGHT OF BODY ON STARTER CRANK. ENGINE
COMPRESSION SHOULD SUSTAIN THE WEIGHT OF AN AVERAGE SIZE RIDER SEVERAL
SECONDS BEFORE CRANK PASSES THROUGH COMPLETE RANGE OF ITS TRAVEL. IF
ENGINE OFFERS LITTLE RESISTANCE TO STARTER CRANK IN TESTING EITHER OR
BOTH CYLINDERS, IT IS AN INDICATION THAT COMPRESSION IS NOT ADEQUATE IN
ONE OR BOTH CYLINDERS. NO CLEARANCE OR INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AT VALVE
TAPPETS; VALVES STICKING IN GUIDES; VALVES SEATING POORLY; CYLINDER
HEADS LEAKING; SPARK PLUGS LOOSE IN HEADS; PISTON RINGS BADLY WORN
AND/OR BROKEN; CYLINDER AND PISTONS BADLY WORN, OR LACK OF LUBRICATION
COULD CAUSE THE ABOVE CONDITION. MAKE EXTERNAL CHECKS FIRST: SEE THAT
OIL IS IN TANK, THAT SPARK PLUGS ARE TIGHT, AND EXAMINE AROUND CYLINDER
HEADS FOR SIGNS OF LEAKING OIL DEPOSITS. IN EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER,
RESISTANCE TO THE STARTER CRANK IS INCREASED BY STIFF OIL IN ENGINE
AND TRANSMISSION. THEREFORE, DO NOT MISTAKE THIS CONDITION TO INDICATE
ACTUAL ENGINE COMPRESSION.

(2) ABNORMAL ENGINE NOISE. OWING TO CONSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN OF THE
MOTORCYCLE, CORRECT ADJUSTMENT OF THE SEVERAL UNITS AND COMPONENTS
IS NECESSARY FOR SMOOTH AND NORMALLY QUIET ENGINE OPERATION. MANY
MOTORCYCLES HAVE BEEN DEADLINED AND ENGINES EXCHANGED BECAUSE
SIMPLE TUNEUP SERVICE AND CORRECT ADJUSTMENT OF COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN
NEGLECTED. ROUGH, JERKY, AND NOISY ENGINE ACTION AT LOW SPEED RIDING
IS USUALLY CAUSED BY EXCESSIVELY LOOSE FRONT AND REAR DRIVE CHAINS,
OR BY A TRANSMISSION BEING LOOSE IN ITS FRAME MOUNTING. FAST IDLING
OF ENGINE WITH THE FRONT DRIVE CHAIN TOO LOOSE, MAY GIVE THE FALSE
IMPRESSION THAT THE ENGINE BEARINGS AND PISTONS NEED REPLACEMENT
SERVICE. ENGINE SPROCKET LOOSE ON ITS SHAFT WILL CAUSE A POUNDING NOISE
SIMILAR TO THAT OF BADLY WORN ENGINE BEARINGS. IF FRONT DRIVE CHAIN
IS TOO TIGHT, OR ENGINE SPROCKET AND CHAIN ARE BADLY WORN, A GRINDING
NOISE RESULTS, SEEMING TO COME FROM THE ENGINE. EXCESSIVELY LOOSE VALVE
TAPPETS WILL CAUSE ABNORMAL METALLIC NOISE IN THE VALVE TIMING GEAR
TRAIN AND ENGINE CRANKCASE. SPARK ADVANCED TOO FAR WILL CAUSE ROUGH
ENGINE PERFORMANCE AT LOW SPEEDS AS WELL AS SPARK KNOCK, POUNDING,
AND OVERHEATING. ENGINE POUNDING AND ROUGH OPERATION WITH CONSEQUENT
NOISE, RESULT FROM LOOSE MOUNTING BOLTS. GENERATOR MOUNTED TO GIVE
INSUFFICIENT GEARTOOTH CLEARANCE WILL CAUSE HOWL IN GEAR CASE.

30. ENGINE LUBRICATING SYSTEM.

=A.= ACTION OF THE OIL FEED PUMP IS INDICATED BY THE RED SIGNAL LIGHT
LOCATED IN RIGHT SIDE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL. (RED SIGNAL LIGHT IS
NORMALLY GROUNDED BY THE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH. WHEN OIL PUMP PRESSURE
IS BUILT UP SEVERAL POUNDS, DIAPHRAGM OPENS THE SIGNAL LIGHT CIRCUIT.)
ACTION OF THE SCAVENGER (OIL RETURN) PUMP IS INDICATED (ENGINE RUNNING)
BY OIL DRIPPING FROM 1/8-INCH HOLE IN OIL RETURN TUBE (LARGE TUBE)
INSIDE OIL TANK, JUST BACK OF OIL GAGE ROD (DIP STICK) TUBE. SINCE
THE OIL FEED PUMP AND SCAVENGER PUMP ARE SEPARATE UNITS, OPERATED
INDIVIDUALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE (DUE TO FAULTY UNIT) FOR EITHER TO
FUNCTION ALONE, THUS AFFECTING ENGINE OIL PRESSURE AND RETURN OF OIL
TO THE TANK. ACTION OF THE VENT PIPE (SMALL PIPE) LOCATED WITHIN THE
OIL TANK IS OF A BREATHER NATURE; ITS FUNCTION NOT BEING INDICATED IN
ANY MANNER. BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO DIAGNOSE TROUBLE IN ENGINE LUBRICATING
SYSTEM, RIDER MUST BE FAMILIAR WITH AND UNDERSTAND INDICATIONS BY
INSTRUMENT PANEL SIGNAL LIGHTS (PAR. 7 =F=).

=B. RED SIGNAL LIGHT FAILS TO BURN WHEN IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH IS
TURNED ON.=

(1) CHECK OTHER LIGHTS TO DETERMINE IF BATTERY IS UP AND THAT SWITCH
AND WIRING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BATTERY AND SWITCH ARE IN GOOD ORDER.
SEE THAT WIRE CONNECTION IS SECURE AND SCREW IS TIGHT ON OIL PRESSURE
SWITCH TERMINAL. FAILURE OF LIGHT TO BURN AFTER THESE CHECKS INDICATES
THAT EITHER THE LAMP IS BURNED OUT OR OIL PRESSURE SWITCH IS FAULTY.

(2) TEST TO ELIMINATE THE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH BY REMOVING WIRE FROM
SWITCH TERMINAL; GROUND WIRE ON SWITCH BODY AND NOTE IF RED LIGHT BURNS
WITH IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH IN ON POSITION. IF LIGHT BURNS, IT
INDICATES THAT OIL PRESSURE SWITCH IS FAULTY, AND MUST BE REPLACED.
IF LIGHT DOES NOT BURN IN MAKING THIS TEST, IT INDICATES THAT LAMP IS
BURNED OUT. REMOVE PANEL COVER (PAR. 119) AND REPLACE LAMP.

=C. RED SIGNAL LIGHT CONTINUES TO BURN AFTER ENGINE IS OPERATED ABOVE
IDLING SPEEDS.=

(1) CHECK OIL SUPPLY IN TANK. IF LIGHT FAILS TO GO OUT AFTER ENGINE
IS WARM, OR AFTER 1 MINUTE OF OPERATION, FURTHER CHECKS MUST BE MADE
TO LOCATE TROUBLE, AS INDICATION POINTS TO FAULTY ENGINE LUBRICATION
SYSTEM, OR FAULT IN SIGNAL CIRCUIT. ELIMINATE THE SIGNAL SYSTEM FIRST.

(2) TEST OIL PRESSURE SIGNAL SWITCH TO PANEL SIGNAL LIGHT CIRCUIT.
REMOVE WIRE FROM OIL PRESSURE SWITCH TERMINAL BY TURNING ON IGNITION
AND LIGHT SWITCH AND OBSERVING RED SIGNAL LIGHT. IF LIGHT BURNS, SHORT
CIRCUIT IN WIRING EXISTS. IF LIGHT DOES NOT BURN, IT INDICATES NORMAL
CONDITION, LEAVING OIL PRESSURE SWITCH OF THE SIGNAL CIRCUIT TO BE
TESTED.

(3) INSTALL NEW OIL PRESSURE SWITCH AND START ENGINE. IF RED SIGNAL
LIGHT GOES OUT AFTER ENGINE IS OPERATED ABOVE IDLING SPEEDS, IT
INDICATES TROUBLE IN OIL PRESSURE SIGNAL SWITCH. IF RED SIGNAL LIGHT
CONTINUES TO BURN, IT INDICATES TROUBLE IN OIL FEED PUMP. REPLACE PUMP
(PAR. 44).

=D. EXCESSIVE SMOKE ISSUES FROM EXHAUST AND OIL SPRAY ISSUES FROM
GEAR CASE BREATHER OUTLET.= THIS IS AN INDICATION THAT THE SCAVENGER
PUMP IS NOT DRAINING ENGINE CRANKCASE AND RETURNING OIL TO TANK. WITH
ENGINE RUNNING AT IDLE SPEED, EXAMINE OIL RETURN IN TANK. REMOVE TANK
OIL CAP, AND WITH A SMALL FLASHLIGHT (TACTICAL SITUATION PERMITTING),
OBSERVE WHETHER OR NOT OIL IS DRIPPING FROM 1/8-INCH HOLE IN OIL RETURN
TUBE. HOLE IS ON UNDER SIDE OF TUBE AND IS LOCATED JUST BACK OF OIL
GAGE ROD TUBE. IF OBSERVATION IS POOR, PLACE FINGER OVER HOLE AND
FEEL FOR PULSATION OF OIL PRESSURE. IF OIL DOES NOT RETURN TO TANK,
SCAVENGER PUMP IS FAULTY. SHOULD THE CRANKCASE BREATHER VALVE BE
INCORRECTLY TIMED, SMOKE WILL ISSUE FROM THE EXHAUST, BUT NOT AS
NOTICEABLY AS WHEN SCAVENGER PUMP IS NOT WORKING. REFER TO STEP E BELOW
FOR THIS CONDITION.

=E. SMOKE ISSUES FROM EXHAUST AND EXCESSIVE OIL CONDITION EXISTS AROUND
CYLINDER EXHAUST PORTS= (=WHERE EXHAUST PIPES ENTER CYLINDERS=). ENGINE
SCAVENGER PUMP AND CRANKCASE BREATHER VALVE ARE ONE UNIT, OPERATED BY
WORM GEAR LOCATED BEHIND ENGINE SHAFT PINION GEAR. ALTHOUGH SCAVENGER
PUMP IS NOT TIMED, THE BREATHER VALVE SLEEVE WHICH DRIVES IT MUST BE
TIMED TO BALANCE THE ENGINE LUBRICATING SYSTEM. IF FOR ANY REASON THE
SCAVENGER PUMP UNIT IS REMOVED FROM ENGINE BASE, THE BREATHER VALVE
MUST BE RETIMED (WITHIN THE GEAR CASE) WHEN PUMP ASSEMBLY IS REPLACED.
INCORRECTLY TIMED BREATHER VALVE WILL FORCE OIL PAST PISTON RINGS,
CAUSING SOME SMOKE, BESIDES FORCING OIL OUT THROUGH EXHAUST PORTS,
CAUSING EXCESSIVE OILY CONDITION AROUND EXHAUST PIPES WHERE THEY ENTER
CYLINDER PORTS.

31. FUEL SYSTEM.

=A.= MANY SYMPTOMS WHICH MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE AIRFUEL SYSTEM
ARE, IN REALITY, DUE TO FAULTY IGNITION. BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANY BUT THE
OBVIOUSLY REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS, CHECK THE IGNITION SYSTEM THOROUGHLY.
GASOLINE TANK SUPPLY VALVE IS A DUAL PURPOSE VALVE, AND ITS OPERATION
IS EXPLAINED IN PARAGRAPH 5 =B=.

=B.= SHUT OFF GASOLINE SUPPLY VALVE. DISCONNECT FUEL LINE AT STRAINER,
OPEN VALVE, AND OBSERVE FREE FLOW OF FUEL FROM PIPE. IF LINE IS
PLUGGED, REMOVE, CLEAN OUT, AND REPLACE.

=C.= REMOVE, DISASSEMBLE, CLEAN, AND INSTALL FUEL STRAINER (PAR. 72).

=D. HARD STARTING, SPITTING, AND MISFIRING CAUSED BY WATER IN FUEL.=
REMOVE DRAIN SCREW FROM CARBURETOR BOWL, DRAIN BOWL, AND REPLACE SCREW.
TAKE CARE NOT TO CROSS DRAIN SCREW THREADS WHEN REPLACING. IF THERE IS
STILL EVIDENCE OF WATER, DIRT, OR OTHER FOREIGN MATTER AFTER BOWL IS
DRAINED, REPLACE CARBURETOR (PARS. 70 AND 71). REMOVE AIR CLEANER OIL
CUP AND INSPECT FOR EVIDENCE OF WATER IN OIL. DRAIN, CLEAN, REFILL TO
CORRECT LEVEL MARK, AND REPLACE CUP. SHOULD ABOVE PROCEDURE FAIL TO
ELIMINATE TROUBLE, DRAIN FUEL TANK BY REMOVING DRAIN PLUG LOCATED UNDER
TANK IN FORWARD POSITION. REPLACE DRAIN PLUG AND REFILL TANK WITH FUEL.

=E. HARD STARTING, OR MISSING AT IDLING AND LOW SPEEDS.= CARBURETOR
LOW SPEED CIRCUIT IN NEED OF ADJUSTMENT (PAR. 68). CARBURETOR HIGH
SPEED CIRCUIT IS CONTROLLED BY A FIXED JET.

=F. IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN SATISFACTORY CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT: LEAN
SPOT BETWEEN IDLING AND UP TO 30 MILES PER HOUR SPEEDS.= CARBURETORS
IN SERVICE FOR SOME TIME BECOME DIRTY AND CRUST FORMS IN THE THROTTLE
BARREL, MAKING SATISFACTORY LOW SPEED ADJUSTMENT DIFFICULT, IF NOT
IMPOSSIBLE. REPLACE CARBURETOR (PARS. 70 AND 71).

=G. FUEL LEAKING FROM CARBURETOR.= EVIDENCE OF DIRT IN FLOAT VALVE,
INCORRECT FLOAT LEVEL, OR FAULTY FLOAT. REPLACE CARBURETOR (PARS. 70
AND 71).

=H. DIFFICULT STARTING, FUEL MIXTURE TOO RICH.= AIR CLEANER OIL
CUP OVERFILLED, OR CLEANER ELEMENTS EXCEPTIONALLY DIRTY, CHOKING OFF
ADEQUATE AIR SUPPLY TO CARBURETOR. CHECK THE OIL CUP LEVEL. IF OIL CUP
LEVEL IS CORRECT, REMOVE, CLEAN, AND INSTALL CLEANER ELEMENTS (PAR. 76).

32. IGNITION SYSTEM.

=A.= WHEN CHECKING IGNITION SYSTEM FOR TROUBLE, MAKE THE MOST OBVIOUS
AND SIMPLE CHECKS FIRST. FOR EXAMPLE: TURN ON IGNITION AND LIGHT
SWITCH, OBSERVE LIGHTS TO ASCERTAIN BATTERY CURRENT SUPPLY; THEN CHECK
TO SEE THAT CURRENT IS REACHING SPARK COIL, CIRCUIT BREAKER, ETC.
FAULTY SPARK PLUGS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF ENGINE
IGNITION TROUBLES. THERE IS NO SERVICE FOR SPARK PLUGS OTHER THAN
SANDBLAST CLEANING AND CORRECT ADJUSTMENT OF ELECTRODES. QUESTIONABLE
SPARK PLUGS MUST BE REPLACED (PAR. 83).

=B.= REMEDY ALL POOR CONNECTIONS IN IGNITION WIRING SYSTEM (FIG. 48).

=C.= REMOVE CIRCUIT BREAKER COVER, OPERATE ENGINE WITH STARTER PEDAL,
AND OBSERVE OPENING AND CLOSING OF CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS. CORRECT
POINT GAP WHEN BREAKER LEVER FIBER IS ON HIGHEST POINT OF CAM IS 0.022
INCH. FOR ADJUSTMENT REFER TO PARAGRAPH 84.

=D. TESTING FOR HIGH TENSION SPARK.= SPARK AT PLUG GAPS DEPENDS
UPON CONDITION AND OPERATION OF CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS, CONDITION OF
CONDENSER, AND CONDITION OF SPARK COIL AND HIGHTENSION CABLES. TESTING
THE IGNITION SYSTEM IS BEST DONE BY MEANS OF ELIMINATION, TESTING
EACH UNIT BY REPLACEMENT UNTIL TROUBLE IS LOCATED; THEN REPLACING
SERVICEABLE UNITS WHICH WERE REMOVED.

(1) REMOVE SPARK PLUG CABLE TERMINAL FROM EITHER PLUG, LEAVING OTHER
CABLE AND PLUG CONNECTED (TO EFFECT GROUND RETURN OF HIGHTENSION
CURRENT); TURN ENGINE UNTIL CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS ARE CLOSED; TURN
IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH ON; HOLD HIGH TENSION CABLE TERMINAL 1/4 INCH
FROM CYLINDER; OPEN AND CLOSE CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS WITH FINGER AND
OBSERVE SPARK JUMP AT GAP. IF SPARK JUMPS GAP, IT INDICATES IGNITION
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CIRCUITS ARE COMPLETE.

(2) NO SPARK AT HIGHTENSION GAP CALLS FOR TESTING OF PRIMARY AND
SECONDARY CIRCUITS. TURN ENGINE UNTIL BREAKER POINTS ARE HELD OPEN;
HOLD CABLE END 1/4 INCH FROM CYLINDER; TURN IGNITION SWITCH ON AND WITH
THE BIT OF A SCREWDRIVER, MAKE A GOOD GROUND CONNECTION BETWEEN BREAKER
MOVABLE (LEVER) POINT, AND THE GROUND. IF A GOOD SPARK IS OBTAINED
AT HIGHTENSION CABLE TERMINAL GAP WHEN GROUND CONNECTION MADE BY
SCREWDRIVER IS BROKEN, CLEAN OR REPLACE FAULTY BREAKER POINTS (PAR. 84).

(3) IF CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT NO SPARK (OR
A VERY WEAK SPARK) OCCURS AT HIGHTENSION GAP, REPLACE CONDENSER (PAR.
85) AND REPEAT TEST UNDER STEP (1) ABOVE. IF REPLACEMENT OF CONDENSER
DOES NOT REMEDY TROUBLE, REPLACE SPARK COIL (PAR. 89).

(4) IF TESTS MADE UNDER STEPS D (1), (2), AND (3) ABOVE SHOW IGNITION
SYSTEM TO BE IN GOOD ORDER (NO UNITS HAVING BEEN REPLACED), AND
IGNITION TROUBLE STILL EXISTS, IT MEANS THAT BREAKER POINTS, CONDENSER,
AND SPARK COIL MUST BE REPLACED WITH NEW UNITS AND ENGINE ROAD TEST
MADE WITH EACH REPLACEMENT UNTIL TROUBLE HAS BEEN LOCATED AND REMEDIED.

=E. IGNITION SYSTEM TESTS SATISFACTORY BUT ENGINE STARTS HARD,
OVERHEATS OR MISSES.= CLEARLY AN INDICATION THAT SPARK PLUGS ARE
FAULTY. REMOVE SPARK PLUGS, CLEAN WITH SANDBLAST, REGAP POINTS BETWEEN
0.028 INCH TO 0.030 INCH AND REINSTALL. REPLACE DEFECTIVE PLUGS WITH
NEW ONES OF CORRECT (NO. 2) HEAT RANGE (PAR. 83).

=F. ENGINE MISSES AFTER WARMUP, OR WHEN QUITE HOT.= REPLACEMENT OF
SPARK PLUGS SHOULD REMEDY THIS TROUBLE. IF IT DOES NOT, THEN EITHER THE
CONDENSER OR SPARK COIL IS AT FAULT. REPLACE CONDENSER FIRST (PAR. 85).
IF NEW CONDENSER FAILS TO CORRECT TROUBLE, REPLACE SPARK COIL (PAR. 89).

33. GENERATING SYSTEM.

=A. PANEL GREEN SIGNAL LIGHT CONTINUES TO BURN ABOVE 20 MILES
PER HOUR.= CORRECT FAULTY WIRING AND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BATTERY
AND GENERATOR. REFER TO FIGURE 55. INSPECT CONDITION OF RELAY AND,
IF NECESSARY, REPLACE (PAR. 95). INSPECT BRUSHES AND COMMUTATOR OF
GENERATOR. CLEAN COMMUTATOR IF NECESSARY (PAR. 91). IF BRUSHES ARE
STICKING IN HOLDERS OR BADLY WORN, REPLACE GENERATOR (PARS. 93 AND 94).

=B. GENERATOR OUTPUT FAILS TO KEEP BATTERY CHARGED ALTHOUGH GREEN
SIGNAL LIGHT BEHAVIOR IS SATISFACTORY.= TEST BATTERY: IF IT WILL NOT
HOLD CHARGE, OR IS DEFECTIVE, REPLACE (PAR. 113). IF THE MACHINE IS
USED MOST OF THE TIME FOR NIGHT OPERATION, HAVE A HIGHER ECHELON
INCREASE THE GENERATING CHARGING RATE. INSPECT BRUSHES AND COMMUTATOR
OF GENERATOR. CLEAN COMMUTATOR IF NECESSARY (PAR. 91). IF BRUSHES ARE
BADLY WORN OR STICKING IN HOLDERS, REPLACE GENERATOR (PARS. 93 AND 94).

34. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

=A. PANEL LAMPS DO NOT LIGHT WHEN SWITCH IS TURNED ON.= EXAMINE
EACH LAMP AND IF BURNED OUT, REPLACE (PAR. 120). EXAMINE BATTERY; IF
DISCHARGED, REPLACE (PAR. 113). REMEDY DEFECTIVE WIRING AND CONNECTIONS
(FIG. 71). TEST LIGHT SWITCH: IF DEFECTIVE, REPLACE (PAR. 116). TEST
BLACKOUT LIGHT SWITCH (IN LAMP BODY): IF DEFECTIVE, REPLACE LAMP (PAR.
114).

=B. LIGHTS BURN DIM BUT BRIGHTEN UP CONSIDERABLY WHEN ENGINE IS
ACCELERATED.= TEST BATTERY WITH HYDROMETER. IF IT IS NOT FULLY CHARGED,
REPLACE (PAR. 113). REMEDY DEFECTIVE WIRING, CONNECTIONS, AND SWITCHES
IN CIRCUIT (FIG. 73). IF THE BATTERY RUNS DOWN AGAIN AFTER A SHORT
PERIOD OF OPERATION, HAVE THE GENERATOR OUTPUT INCREASED (REFER TO A
HIGHER ECHELON).

=C. LIGHTS EXCEED NORMAL BRILLIANCY WHEN ACCELERATING ENGINE.=
EXAMINE BATTERY: IF DEFECTIVE, REPLACE (PAR. 113). REMEDY FAULTY WIRING
AND CONNECTIONS (FIG. 73). DO NOT FORGET THE GROUND CONNECTION OF THE
LAMP BODY.

=D. BLACKOUT STOP LAMP AND/OR SERVICE STOP LAMP FAIL TO LIGHT.= IF
THE UNIT IS BURNED OUT, REPLACE IT (PAR. 115). IF THE BRAKE PEDAL IS
NOT OPERATING SWITCH, REMEDY THE FAULTY OPERATION. REMEDY ALL FAULTY
WIRING AND CONNECTIONS (FIG. 73).

=E. HORN DOES NOT SOUND WHEN IGNITION AND LIGHT SWITCH IS TURNED
ON AND HORN BUTTON IS PRESSED.= TEST BATTERY BY TURNING ON LIGHTS. IF
LIGHTS ARE DIM, REPLACE BATTERY (PAR. 113). REMEDY DEFECTIVE WIRING
AND CONNECTIONS (FIG. 73). IF THE HORN DOES NOT RESPOND TO ADJUSTMENT,
REPLACE (PAR. 117).

35. TRANSMISSION AND CLUTCH.

=A.= NEED FOR ATTENTION TO CLUTCH AND CONTROLS IS INDICATED BY CLUTCH
SLIPPING UNDER LOAD OR DRAGGING (TRANSMISSION GEARS WILL SHIFT HARD AND
CLASH) WHEN IN DISENGAGED POSITION. IN EITHER CASE, THE FIRST THING TO
BE CHECKED IS ADJUSTMENT OF CONTROLS; THIS BEING THE ATTENTION USUALLY
NEEDED. INDICATION THAT GEAR SHIFTER CONTROLS ARE IN NEED OF ADJUSTMENT
IS WHEN TRANSMISSION GEARS JUMP OUT OF ENGAGEMENT WHEN ACCELERATING
VEHICLE OR WHEN UNDER HEAVY PULL. CAUTION: THIS WARNING MUST NOT BE
DISREGARDED.

(1) CLUTCH SLIPS WHEN FULLY ENGAGED. ADJUST CLUTCH CONTROL (PAR. 48).
ADJUST CLUTCH SPRING TENSION (PAR. 48). IF THE CLUTCH STILL SLIPS,
REPLACE EITHER THE DISKS, SPRINGS, OR BOTH (PAR. 48).

(2) CLUTCH DRAGS WHEN FULLY DISENGAGED. ADJUST CONTROL (PAR. 48).
ADJUST SPRING TENSION (PAR. 48).

(3) CLUTCH RATTLES WHEN IN DISENGAGED POSITION, ENGINE IDLING. IN
THIS CASE, THE CLUTCH PROBABLY WAS NOT PROPERLY ASSEMBLED. REFER TO
PARAGRAPH 51 =A=.

(4) TRANSMISSION JUMPS OUT OF GEAR UPON ACCELERATING VEHICLE, OR WHEN
UNDER HEAVY PULL. ADJUST SHIFTER LEVER CONTROL LINKAGE (PAR. 54).

(5) TRANSMISSION GEARS SHIFT HARD OR CLASH WHEN CLUTCH IS FULLY
DISENGAGED. ADJUST CLUTCH CONTROL LINKAGE AND SPRING TENSION (PAR. 48).
MAKE SURE THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTING BOLTS AND UNITS ARE TIGHT (PARS.
57 AND 58). DRAIN AND FILL TRANSMISSION WITH CORRECT LUBRICANT (FIG.
10). IF THE ABOVE METHODS FAIL TO CURE THE SYMPTOM, REFER TO A HIGHER
AUTHORITY.

36. WHEELS AND CHAINS.

=A. TRANSMISSION COUNTERSHAFT AND REAR WHEEL SPROCKETS SHOW EXCESSIVE
WEAR ON ONE SIDE OF TEETH.= ADJUST THE POSITION OF THE REAR WHEEL AXLE
TO ALINE THE REAR WHEEL SPROCKET WITH THE TRANSMISSION SPROCKET (PAR.
60). IF THEY CANNOT BE ALINED, THE FRAME IS OUT OF ALINEMENT, AND THE
TROUBLE MUST BE REFERRED TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY.

=B. CHAINS PRODUCE GRINDING NOISE WITH ENGINE IDLING AND VEHICLE ON
REAR STAND.= IF EITHER CHAIN IS ADJUSTED TOO TIGHT, ADJUST TO PROPER
TENSION (PARS. 59 AND 60). EXAMINE BOTH CHAINS FOR PRESENCE OF DIRT
AND GRIT. IF DIRTY, CLEAN AND LUBRICATE THEM (PAR. 20 =C= (10)). IF
EITHER CHAIN IS DRY, ADJUST CHAIN OILERS (PAR. 61). BADLY WORN CHAINS
AND SPROCKETS WILL CAUSE THIS SYMPTOM; THE WORN PARTS MUST BE REPLACED
(PARS. 62 AND 63).

=C. FRONT CHAIN DRY AND/OR RED (RUSTY) IN APPEARANCE.= THE CHAIN IN
THIS CONDITION HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVING ENOUGH LUBRICATION. ADJUST CHAIN
OILER (PAR. 61). IF THE CHAIN IS DAMAGED FROM LACK OF OIL, REPLACE
(PAR. 62).

=D. ROUGH OR JERKY VEHICLE OPERATION AT LOW SPEED.= CHAINS ARE TOO
LOOSE. ADJUST (PARS. 59 AND 60).

=E. EXCESSIVE SIDE PLAY AT RIM OF FRONT WHEEL.= ADJUST BEARING CONES
(PAR. 126). IF THE CONES AND OR HUB RACES ARE BADLY WORN, REPLACE WHEEL
(PAR. 125).

=F. FRONT WHEEL SPINNING TEST PRODUCES GRINDING, GRATING NOISE (NOT
IN BRAKE).= THE WHEEL BEARINGS ARE DEFECTIVE. REPLACE WHEEL (PAR. 125).

=G. REAR WHEEL HAS EXCESSIVE SIDE PLAY AT RIM OF WHEEL.= THE HUB
BEARINGS ARE DEFECTIVE. REPLACE WHEEL (PAR. 127).

=H. REAR WHEEL HAS SIDE PLAY IN EXCESS OF 0.010 INCH ON AXLE.= THE
THRUST WASHERS OF HUB ARE WORN OR DAMAGED. REPLACE WHEEL (PAR. 127).

=I. REAR WHEEL SPINNING TEST PRODUCES GRINDING, GRATING NOISE=
(=CHAIN REMOVED=). TIGHTEN WHEEL MOUNTING SCREWS. IF THIS DOES NOT
CORRECT NOISE, REPLACE WHEEL (PAR. 127).

37. BRAKES.

=A. REAR BRAKE DOES NOT HOLD WHEN FOOT PEDAL IS DEPRESSED.= IF THE
BRAKE LININGS ARE WET, OPERATE THE VEHICLE AND APPLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE
TO THE BRAKE PEDAL TO DRY OUT LININGS. AFTER DRYING THE LININGS ADJUST
BRAKE ROD LENGTH (PAR. 96 B). IF THE BRAKE OPERATING LEVER STANDS AHEAD
OF THE VERTICAL POSITION WITH BRAKE APPLIED, OR THE BRAKE DOES NOT
HOLD, REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE BRAKE SHOES (PAR. 96).

=B. REAR BRAKE SQUEAKS OR CHATTERS WHEN USED.= TIGHTEN SIDE PLATE
SLEEVE NUT, IF IT IS LOOSE. ADJUST SHOE POSITION (PAR. 96). IF THE
OPERATING CAMSHAFT AND/OR SIDE COVER BEARING IS WORN, REPLACE THE
ASSEMBLY (PAR. 96). IF THE BRAKE SHOE SPRING IS DEFECTIVE, REPLACE
(PAR. 96). IF THE LINING ON THE BRAKE SHOES IS LOOSE, WORN, OR
DEFECTIVE, REPLACE SHOES (PAR. 96). IF THE BRAKE DRUM IS WORN OR
DAMAGED, REPLACE THE BRAKE DRUM AND SPROCKET ASSEMBLY (PAR. 96).

=C. REAR BRAKE DRAGS (VEHICLE ON REAR STAND).= ADJUST LINKAGE (PAR.
96). IF IT STILL DRAGS, EQUALIZE SHOE ASSEMBLIES, AND ADJUST LINKAGE
(PAR. 96).

=D. FRONT BRAKE DOES NOT HOLD WHEN HAND LEVER IS OPERATED.= ADJUST
BRAKE CONTROL (PAR. 97). IF BRAKES ARE WET, OPERATE VEHICLE A SHORT
DISTANCE WITH SLIGHT PRESSURE ON BRAKE LEVER TO DRY OUT LININGS. IF
BRAKE DOES NOT HOLD, REPLACE SHOES (PAR. 97).

=E. FRONT BRAKE DRAGS.= ADJUST CONTROL LINKAGE (PAR. 97). IF BRAKE
STILL DRAGS, EQUALIZE SHOES AND READJUST CONTROL LINKAGE (PAR. 97).

=F. FRONT BRAKE ACTION ROUGH AND/OR CHATTERS.= ADJUST CONTROL LINKAGE
ASSEMBLY (PAR. 97). IF MALFUNCTION CONTINUES, EXAMINE BRAKE SHOES,
SHOE SPRING, CAMSHAFT BEARING AND SIDE COVER BEARING. REPLACE ANY
DEFECTIVE PARTS OR ASSEMBLIES (PAR. 97).

38. STEERING.

=A. MOTORCYCLE PULLS TO ONE SIDE.= INSPECT AND CORRECT ALINEMENT OF
REAR WHEEL (PAR. 60). IF THE FRONT FORKS ARE BENT OR TWISTED, REPLACE
(PAR. 98). IF TROUBLE PERSISTS, REFER TO HIGHER AUTHORITY.

=B. MOTORCYCLE WEAVES FROM SIDE TO SIDE.= ADJUST STEERING DAMPER TO
SUIT SPEED AND ROAD CONDITIONS. IF THIS FAILS, INFLATE TIRES TO CORRECT
PRESSURE. MAKE SURE REAR WHEEL MOUNTING SCREWS ARE TIGHT. IF THE
STEERING HEAD BEARINGS ARE TOO TIGHT, WEAVING WILL RESULT. CHECK THE
STEERING HEAD BEARINGS (PAR. 98), AND ADJUST IF NECESSARY.

=C. MOTORCYCLE SHIMMIES AT HIGH SPEED.= INFLATE TIRES TO CORRECT
PRESSURE. ADJUST STEERING DAMPER TO SUIT SPEED AND ROAD CONDITIONS. IF
THE TIRE TREAD IS UNEVENLY WORN, AND SHIFTING TIRES DOES NOT CORRECT
THE CONDITION, REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE CASINGS. MAKE SURE THE AXLE NUTS
ARE TIGHT. IF THE ROCKER PLATE STUDS AND BUSHINGS ARE BADLY WORN, OR

39. DESCRIPTION AND DATA.

=A. DESCRIPTION.= THIS 2CYLINDER, VTYPE, AIRCOOLED GASOLINE ENGINE
OF LHEAD DESIGN OPERATES ON THE 4STROKE, 4CYCLE PRINCIPLE. FLYWHEEL

41. REPLACEMENT OF HEAD GASKET (FIG. 15).

=A. REMOVAL.= REFER TO FIGURE 15, ILLUSTRATING NECESSARY PARTS AND
UNITS TO BE REMOVED TO PERFORM THIS OPERATION.

(1) REMOVE INSTRUMENT PANEL COVER (PAR. 119).

(2) REMOVE GASOLINE TANK AND OIL TANK (PAR. 107).

(3) REMOVE CYLINDER HEAD BRACKET TO FRAME LUG BOLT: THIS WILL FREE
CLAMP WHICH SECURES FRONT SPARK PLUG CABLE. PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION
TO SHIM WASHERS PLACED BETWEEN CYLINDER HEAD BRACKET AND FRAME LUG, AS
THESE WASHERS MUST BE REPLACED WHEN INSTALLING CYLINDER HEAD.

(4) REMOVE SPARK PLUG, OR PLUGS.

(5) REMOVE CYLINDER HEAD BOLTS, USING HEAD BOLT WRENCH 41-W-1525. NOTE:
ON SOME 42 WLA MODELS, PLAIN WASHERS (0.095-INCH THICK), IN ADDITION
TO REGULAR (HEAVY) CYLINDER HEAD BOLT WASHERS, WERE USED TO PREVENT
CYLINDER HEAD BOLTS FROM BOTTOMING.

(6) PERFORM CARBON REMOVAL (HEAD ONLY). REFER TO PARAGRAPH 42.

=B. INSTALLING GASKET AND HEAD= (FIG. 15).

(1) CLEAN TOP OF CYLINDER. APPLY A LIGHT APPLICATION OF GREASE OR OIL
TO BOTH SIDES OF GASKET BEFORE LOCATING ON CYLINDER HEAD. PLACE HEAD ON
CYLINDER.

(2) INSTALL HEAD BOLTS, USING HEAVY WASHERS (ALSO 0.095-INCH THICK
PLAIN WASHERS, IF ANY WERE REMOVED). IF IN DOUBT AS TO USE OF
0.095-INCH THICK WASHERS IN ADDITION TO REGULAR WASHERS, MEASURE DEPTH
OF BOLT HOLES IN CYLINDER HEAD. HEAD HAVING HOLE DEPTH OF 31/32 INCH
MUST USE THE 0.095-INCH THICK WASHERS IN ADDITION TO REGULAR WASHERS.
HEAD HAVING BOLT HOLE DEPTH OF 1-1/16 INCH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE
0.095-INCH THICK WASHERS.

(3) INSTALL CYLINDER FRAME BRACKET WITH THE TWO LONG BOLTS, SPECIAL
(SPOOLSHAPED) SPACERS, AND FLAT WASHERS. THE SPACERS GO BETWEEN
CYLINDER HEADS AND FRAME BRACKET. A FLAT WASHER GOES UNDER THE HEAD OF
EACH LONG CYLINDER BOLT, ABOVE THE BRACKET; SOME ENGINES MAY HAVE FLAT
WASHERS BETWEEN THE SPACERS AND THE BRACKET.

(4) TIGHTEN HEAD BOLTS EVENLY TO ENSURE A TIGHT CYLINDER HEAD JOINT.
USE HEAD BOLT WRENCH 41-W-1525, FIRST TURNING DOWN BOLTS JUST SNUG,
THEN TIGHTENING EACH BOLT 1/8 TO 1/4 TURN AT A TIME, UNTIL ALL ARE
SECURELY TIGHTENED. IF TORQUE WRENCH IS AVAILABLE, TIGHTEN HEAD BOLTS
TO 60 FOOTPOUNDS MINIMUM, 65 FOOTPOUNDS MAXIMUM TENSION WHEN ENGINE
IS COLD.

42. CARBON REMOVAL.

=A.= AT TIME CYLINDER HEAD IS REMOVED FOR GASKET REPLACEMENT, CARBON
MUST BE REMOVED FROM HEAD ONLY.

43. VALVE TAPPET ADJUSTMENT (FIG. 16).

=A. ADJUST TAPPETS WITH ENGINE COLD.= BEFORE LOOSENING VALVE SPRING
COVERS, A LIGHT APPLICATION OF OIL AROUND TOP EDGE OF EACH COVER WILL
FACILITATE RAISING COVER WITHOUT DAMAGE TO SEAL PACKING.

(1) LOOSEN VALVE SPRING COVERS; USE TAPPET AND VALVE COVER WRENCH
41-W-3617.

(2) BEFORE CHECKING OR ADJUSTING TAPPET CLEARANCE, MAKE SURE VALVE IS
SEATED AND THAT TAPPET IS AT LOWEST POSITION, BY TURNING ENGINE AHEAD
UNTIL LIKE TAPPET (INLET OR EXHAUST, WHICHEVER ONE IS BEING ADJUSTED)
IN THE OTHER CYLINDER IS AT HIGHEST POSITION (VALVE FULLY OPEN). INLET
VALVES ARE LOCATED NEAREST THE CARBURETOR MANIFOLD.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310211

FIGURE 16VALVE TAPPET ADJUSTMENT]

(4) LOOSEN ADJUSTING SCREW LOCK NUT (2, FIG. 16) SLIGHTLY BEFORE
TURNING ADJUSTING SCREW (FIG. 16).

(5) ADJUST INLET VALVE TAPPETS TO 0.004-INCH MINIMUM, AND 0.005-INCH
MAXIMUM CLEARANCE BETWEEN VALVE STEMS AND TAPPET (1 AND 4, FIG.
16). USE THICKNESS GAGE TO DETERMINE CLEARANCE; RECHECK (CORRECTING IF
NECESSARY) CLEARANCE AFTER LOCK NUT HAS BEEN SECURELY TIGHTENED.

(6) ADJUST EXHAUST VALVE TAPPETS TO 0.006-INCH MINIMUM, AND 0.007-INCH
MAXIMUM CLEARANCE BETWEEN VALVE STEMS AND TAPPET. USE THICKNESS GAGE TO
DETERMINE CLEARANCE; RECHECK (CORRECTING IF NECESSARY) CLEARANCE AFTER
LOCK NUT HAS BEEN SECURELY TIGHTENED.

(7) BEFORE TURNING DOWN VALVE SPRING COVERS, INSPECT PAPER GASKET
BETWEEN EACH COVER AND TAPPET GUIDE. IF BROKEN OR DAMAGED, FIT A NEW
GASKET TO PREVENT OIL LEAK. TURN DOWN AND SECURELY TIGHTEN VALVE SPRING
COVERS.

TANK NIPPLE TO PREVENT OIL FROM RUNNING OUT, OR DRAIN TANK. DISCONNECT
OIL FEED PIPE FROM OIL PUMP NIPPLE.

(2) OIL PUMP IS SECURED TO ENGINE GEAR CASE COVER BY ONE HEXAGON HEAD
BOLT AND THREE NUTS. TWO OF THE NUTS ARE EXTRA LONG TO PROVIDE WRENCH
CLEARANCE, AND THEIR LOCATION SHOULD BE NOTED SO THEY WILL BE PUT BACK
WHERE THEY BELONG WHEN REINSTALLING PUMP. AFTER REMOVING SCREW AND
NUTS, REMOVE PUMP. UNLESS A NEW PUMP GASKET IS AVAILABLE, TAKE CARE
NOT TO DAMAGE OR BREAK THE OLD ONE, AS THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL GASKET
CONCERNING BOTH THICKNESS AND HOLES PROVIDED FOR OIL CHANNELS. A
HOMEMADE GASKET MAY PUT OILING SYSTEM COMPLETELY OUT OF COMMISSION.

=B. INSTALLING OIL PUMP.=

(1) CLEAN SURFACE OF PUMP BODY MOUNTING ON GEAR CASE COVER AND SEE THAT
GASKET IS IN GOOD CONDITION. CLEAN FACE OF OIL PUMP BODY.

=A.= CLUTCH IS OF SIMPLE MULTIPLEDRYDISK TYPE, HAVING TWO STEEL DISKS
AND THREE LINED DISKS, ONE OF WHICH PROVIDES SPRING ACTION WITHIN DISK
PACK TO CUSHION CLUTCH OPERATION.

=48. MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT= (FIGS. 22, 23, 24, AND 25).

=A.= IF CLUTCH ADJUSTMENT IS CORRECTLY MAINTAINED, CLUTCH WILL
CAUSE VERY LITTLE TROUBLE. EASE OF GEAR SHIFTING AND SERVICE LIFE
OF TRANSMISSION GEAR SHIFTER CLUTCH DOGS DEPEND LARGELY UPON FULL
DISENGAGEMENT OF THE CLUTCH. CLUTCH ADJUSTMENT IS IN TWO PARTS; NAMELY,
CONTROL LINKAGE AND SPRING TENSION. DO NOT ADJUST CLUTCH SPRING TENSION
BEFORE CORRECTING CONTROL ADJUSTMENT.

=B. CLUTCH CONTROL LINKAGE= (FIG. 22). OPERATION OF FOOT PEDAL,
CONTROL CABLE, AND CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER ACTUATES THE PUSH ROD THROUGH
HOLLOW TRANSMISSION SHAFT, DISENGAGING OR ENGAGING CLUTCH AT WILL.
CORRECT ADJUSTMENT TO CONTROL CABLE AND RELEASE LEVER MUST BE MADE
BEFORE PUSH ROD ADJUSTMENT IS MADE.

=C. CLUTCH CONTROL ADJUSTMENT= (FIGS. 23, 24, 25, AND 26).

(1) ADJUSTING CABLE LENGTH. WITH CLUTCH IN FULLY DISENGAGED POSITION
(FOOT PEDAL HEEL DOWN) THE CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER MUST CLEAR THE
COUNTERSHAFT SPROCKET COVER STUD AND/OR NUT BY 1/16 INCH. SHOULD CLUTCH
RELEASE LEVER STRIKE SPROCKET COVER AND NUT, CLUTCH PUSH ROD MOVEMENT
IS RESTRICTED, AND CLUTCH CANNOT BE FULLY DISENGAGED. LENGTH OF CONTROL
CABLE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO OBTAIN 1/16-INCH CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER AND
SPROCKET COVER STUD AND/OR NUT CLEARANCE. TO LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN CLUTCH
CONTROL CABLE, CABLE ADJUSTABLE END MUST BE REMOVED FROM FOOT PEDAL
STUD (FIGS. 23 AND 24). WITH FOOT PEDAL IN FORWARD (TOE DOWN) POSITION,
REMOVE COTTER PIN AND WASHER RETAINING CABLE END. RELEASE OTHER END
OF CABLE FROM NOTCH IN CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER BY PRESSING RELEASE LEVER
INWARD AND LIFTING CABLE END OUT OF NOTCH. ROCK THE FOOT PEDAL TO REAR

(2) ADJUSTING CLEARANCE OF CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER AND PUSH ROD (FIG. 25).
WITH CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER AND SPROCKET COVER STUD CLEARANCE CORRECTLY
ADJUSTED (STEP (1) ABOVE), CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER MUST HAVE BETWEEN
1/8-INCH AND 1/4-INCH FREE PLAY AT END WHERE CONTROL CABLE ENGAGES LEVER
NOTCH (FIG. 25). THIS FREE PLAY ENSURES A FULLY ENGAGED CLUTCH WITHOUT
PRESSURE ON CLUTCH RELEASE BEARING. ADJUSTMENT IS MADE BY MEANS OF PUSH
ROD ADJUSTING SCREW LOCATED IN CLUTCH OUTER DISK. REMOVE TWO SCREWS
WHICH SECURE INSPECTION HOLE COVER TO CHAIN GUARD (FIG. 25). IF CLUTCH
RELEASE LEVER HAS LESS THAN 1/8-INCH FREE PLAY AT END OF CABLE, LOOSEN
PUSH ROD ADJUSTING SCREW LOCK NUT AND TURN PUSH ROD ADJUSTING SCREW TO
THE LEFT (COUNTERCLOCKWISE) TO INCREASE AMOUNT OF FREE PLAY. IF CLUTCH
RELEASE LEVER HAS MORE THAN 1/4-INCH FREE PLAY AT END OF CABLE, TURN
ADJUSTING SCREW TO THE RIGHT (CLOCKWISE) TO DECREASE AMOUNT OF FREE
PLAY. TIGHTEN LOCK NUT AFTER CORRECT ADJUSTMENT IS OBTAINED. REPLACE
INSPECTION HOLE COVER. CAUTION: IF END OF CLUTCH RELEASE LEVER HAS NO
FREE PLAY AS EXPLAINED ABOVE, CLUTCH WILL NOT HOLD WHEN FULLY ENGAGED.
IF TOO MUCH FREE PLAY IS ALLOWED, CLUTCH WILL DRAG WHEN DISENGAGED;
CONSEQUENTLY, TRANSMISSION GEARS WILL SHIFT HARD, CLASH, AND EVENTUALLY
BECOME DAMAGED.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310223

FIGURE 26ADJUSTING CLUTCH SPRING TENSION]

=D. ADJUSTING CLUTCH SPRING TENSION= (FIG. 26). IF CLUTCH SLIPS (DOES
NOT HOLD WHEN STARTING ENGINE OR WITH VEHICLE IN OPERATION) AFTER
CONTROLS HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY ADJUSTED (STEP =C= (1) AND (3) ABOVE),
SPRING TENSION MUST BE INCREASED. NOTE: DO NOT INCREASE SPRING TENSION
ANY MORE THAN ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE CLUTCH HOLD.

(1) REMOVE FRONT OUTER CHAIN GUARD (PAR. 102).

(2) BEND DOWN LOCK LIPS TO FREE THE THREE CLUTCH ADJUSTING NUTS.

(3) TURNING NUTS TO RIGHT (CLOCKWISE) INCREASES CLUTCH SPRING TENSION.
TIGHTEN (TURN TO RIGHT) ALL THREE ADJUSTING NUTS, ONEHALF TURN AT A
TIME, UNTIL CLUTCH HOLDS. TEST CLUTCH AFTER EACH HALFTURN OF THE
THREE ADJUSTING NUTS BY CRANKING ENGINE. USUALLY A CLUTCH THAT HOLDS
WITHOUT ANY NOTICEABLE SLIPPAGE WHEN CRANKING ENGINE, ALSO HOLDS ON THE
ROAD.

(4) AFTER CLUTCH SPRING TENSION ADJUSTMENT IS MADE, BEND UP NUT LOCK
LIPS TO SECURE ADJUSTING NUTS. REPLACE ANY BROKEN OR BADLY DAMAGED
LOCKS.

(5) WHEN A NEW CLUTCH IS ORIGINALLY ASSEMBLED AND ADJUSTED, THE
DISTANCE FROM THE INNER EDGE OF SHOULDER ON SPRING COLLAR TO FACE OF
OUTER (RELEASING) DISK IS 1-3/32 INCHES (FIG. 27). IN ANY CASE, DO
NOT TIGHTEN THE THREE ADJUSTING NUTS TO THE POINT WHERE INNER EDGE
OF SHOULDER OF SPRING COLLAR IS CLOSER THAN INCH TO FACE OF OUTER
(RELEASING) DISK. IF COMPRESSED MORE, CLUTCH PROBABLY CANNOT BE FULLY
DISENGAGED.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310224

FIGURE 27MEASURING DISTANCE BETWEEN SPRING COLLAR AND DISK]

(7) IF CLUTCH STILL DOES NOT HOLD, AFTER CORRECT CONTROL AND SPRING
TENSION ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE, CLUTCH PACK ASSEMBLY MUST BE
REPLACED (PAR. 49).

(8) AFTER MAKING CLUTCH SPRING TENSION ADJUSTMENT, REPLACE OUTER FRONT
CHAIN GUARD (PAR. 102).

49. REMOVAL OF DISKS (FIGS. 28, 29, AND 30).

=A.= CLUTCH DISKS CAN BE REMOVED FOR INSPECTION, CLEANING, AND/OR
REPLACING. SPRINGS CAN BE REMOVED FOR CHECKING AND/OR REPLACING
WITHOUT DISTURBING SPROCKET, WHICH IS INTEGRAL WITH CLUTCH SHELL. IT IS
ADVISABLE TO REMOVE RELEASING (OUTER) DISK, SPRINGS, AND COLLAR AS AN
ASSEMBLY BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO CORRECTLY ALINE, HOLD IN PLACE, AND
REASSEMBLE SPRINGS IN THIS UNIT. IF SPRINGS SHOW SIGNS OF OVERHEATING,
AND APPEAR TO BE SET, THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED, MEASURED, AND REPLACED
IF NECESSARY (PAR. 50).

FIGURE 30CLUTCH DISKS, REMOVED]

=B. LOOSE LINER RIVETS.= IF DISK LINER RIVETS ARE LOOSE, REPLACE DISK
AND LINER ASSEMBLY WITH LIKE ASSEMBLY IN NEW OR GOOD ORDER.

=C. OILSOAKED DISK LINERS.= IF LINED DISKS ARE NOT BADLY WORN, BUT
ARE OILSOAKED, WASH THEM THOROUGHLY IN CLEAN GASOLINE AND DRY WITH AIR
OR HEAT.

=D. SHRUNKEN OR WEAK SPRINGS.= IF CLUTCH HAS BEEN BADLY OVERHEATED
AS A RESULT OF SLIPPAGE, SPRINGS MAY BE FOUND IN SHRUNKEN OR WEAKENED
CONDITION. ASSUMING DISK LINERS ARE NOT BADLY WORN, WEAKENED SPRINGS
ARE INDICATED WHEN THE THREE SPRING TENSION NUTS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED
TO MAKE THE CLUTCH HOLD UNTIL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN SPRING COLLAR AND
RELEASING (OUTER) DISK IS INCH. IF SHRUNKEN OR WEAK SPRINGS ARE
SUSPECTED, REMOVE THEM FOR INSPECTION.

(1) TO REMOVE SPRINGS, REMOVE PUSH ROD ADJUSTING SCREW LOCK NUT,
FREEING SPRING COLLAR AND THE 10 SPRINGS FROM THE RELEASING (OUTER)
DISK ASSEMBLY.

(2) MEASURE SPRINGS FOR FREE LENGTH. FREE LENGTH OF NEW CLUTCH SPRINGS
IS APPROXIMATELY 1-1/2 INCHES (THEY MAY VARY PLUS OR MINUS 1/32 INCH).
OLD SPRINGS FOUND TO BE SHRUNK 1/8 INCH (TOTAL FREE LENGTH OF SPRING
IS 1-3/8 INCH OR LESS) MUST BE REPLACED WITH NEW SPRINGS. NOTE: BEFORE
REPLACING SPRINGS, SELECT 10 SPRINGS THAT DO NOT VARY MORE THAN 1/32
INCH TO MAKE UP THE ASSEMBLY.

(3) ASSEMBLING RELEASING DISK, SPRINGS, AND SPRING COLLAR. PLACE THE
10 SPRINGS UPRIGHT ON RELEASING DISK TO CENTRALLY LOCATE EACH OF THE
10 STUD HOLES. PLACE SPRING COLLAR (FLANGED EDGE DOWN) OVER ENDS OF
SPRINGS, LOCATING THE COLLAR PLATE DIMPLES IN ENDS OF 7 OF THE
SPRINGS. PLACE THE LARGE WASHER OVER PUSH ROD ADJUSTING SCREW; TIGHTEN
ADJUSTING SCREW NUT, AND COMPRESS SPRINGS LIGHTLY. TURN ASSEMBLY OVER
AND OBSERVE ALINEMENT OF SPRINGS AND DISK HOLES. IF NECESSARY, INSERT
A 3/8-INCH ROD THROUGH HOLES TO ALINE SPRINGS. TIGHTEN DOWN ADJUSTING
SCREW NUT; ASSEMBLY IS NOW READY FOR COMPLETE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.

51. INSTALLATION OF DISKS (FIGS. 30, 29, AND 28).

=A.= IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN ASSEMBLING A CLUTCH TO START WITH A LINED
DISK. INSTALL THE TWO STEEL DISKS SO THAT THE ANTIRATTLE DEVICES ARE
STAGGERED ON SPLINES IN THE SHELL, AND THE SPRUNG DISK (LINED ON ONE
SIDE) IS THE LAST OF THE PACK, ITS LINED SIDE FACING THE STEEL DISK.
BEFORE INSTALLING DISKS, SEE THAT BEARING RETAINING PLATE LOCK RINGS
(R, FIG. 21) ARE IN PLACE ON THE SHORT STUDS, AND ARE TIGHT AGAINST

53. DESCRIPTION.

=A.= TRANSMISSION HAS THREE SPEEDS: LOW, SECOND, AND HIGH, AND IS OF
THE CONSTANTMESH, NONSELECTIVE TYPE. HIGH GEAR IS DIRECT DRIVE. SINCE
DOGS ON GEAR SHIFTER CLUTCHES ARE USED TO ENGAGE TRANSMISSION GEARS,
IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT VEHICLE CLUTCH IS CORRECTLY ADJUSTED.
CLUTCH MUST BE FULLY DISENGAGED WHEN SHIFTING GEARS, TO PREVENT
CLASHING OF GEARS, AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE SHIFTER CLUTCH DOGS
AND TRANSMISSION GEARS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL
LINKAGE BE KEPT IN CORRECT ADJUSTMENT TO ENSURE FULL ENGAGEMENT OF
SHIFTER CLUTCH DRIVING DOGS IN ALL POSITIONS, THUS PREVENTING POSSIBLE
DAMAGE CAUSED BY DOGS JUMPING OUT OF ENGAGEMENT UNDER DRIVING LOAD.
CLOSE FITTING AND NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS, WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION,
NECESSITATE USE OF ENGINE OIL (SEASONAL GRADE) IN TRANSMISSION CASE FOR
ADEQUATE LUBRICATION.

54. CONTROL LINKAGE (FIG. 32).

=A. TRANSMISSION SHIFTED TO ADJUST FRONT DRIVE CHAIN.= THE
TRANSMISSION IS LOCATED TO RECEIVE POWER FROM FRONT (ENGINE) DRIVE
CHAIN AND TRANSMIT POWER THROUGH REAR DRIVE CHAIN TO REAR WHEEL, AND
IS MOVABLE ON ITS MOUNTING FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE FRONT (ENGINE) DRIVE
CHAIN. WHEN FRONT (ENGINE) DRIVE CHAIN IS ADJUSTED, TRANSMISSION GEAR
SHIFTER CONTROL LINKAGE IS AFFECTED. THEREFORE, AFTER EACH FRONT DRIVE
CHAIN ADJUSTMENT, GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL LINKAGE MUST BE CHECKED, AND, IF
NECESSARY, CORRECTLY ADJUSTED TO ENSURE PROPER GEAR SHIFTING WITH FULL
ENGAGEMENT OF THE GEAR SHIFTER CLUTCH DRIVING DOGS AS WELL AS PREVENT
TRANSMISSION FROM JUMPING OUT OF GEAR UNDER LOAD.

=B. CHECKING GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL LINKAGE.= BEFORE MAKING ADJUSTMENT
TO GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL LINKAGE, MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHECKS: SEE THAT
ALL LINKAGE POINTS FROM TRANSMISSION GEAR SHIFTER LEVER TO GEAR SHIFTER
HAND LEVER ARE WELL OILED AND FREEWORKING. CHECK HAND LEVER PIVOT BOLT
NUT FOR TIGHTNESS. OBSERVE WHETHER THERE IS BINDING OR INTERFERENCE
WITH SHIFTER ROD AT ANY POINT IN THE SHIFTING RANGE; THIS SOMETIMES
RESULTS FROM A BENT SNIFTER ROD. CHECK WHETHER OR NOT SHIFTER ROD
IS CORRECTLY ADJUSTED SO THAT WHEN HAND LEVER IS MOVED TO ANY GEAR
POSITION IN TANK SHIFTER GUIDE, TRANSMISSION LEVER MOVES TO THE PROPER
POSITION TO FULLY ENGAGE SHIFTER CLUTCH DOGS AND SHIFTER CAM SPRING
PLUNGER IN CAMLOCATING NOTCH (INSIDE TRANSMISSION).

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310229

=C. ADJUSTING GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL LINKAGE= (FIG. 32).

(1) SET HAND LEVER IN N (NEUTRAL) POSITION IN SHIFTER GUIDE.

(2) REMOVE NUT AND BOLT TO DISCONNECT SHIFTER ROD FROM HAND LEVER.

(3) WITH SLIGHT BACKWARD AND FORWARD MOVEMENT OF SHIFTER ROD, CAREFULLY
FEEL TRANSMISSION LEVER INTO EXACT POSITION WHERE SHIFTER CAM SPRING
PLUNGER (INSIDE TRANSMISSION) SEATS FULLY IN CAMLOCATING NOTCH.

(4) NEXT, SEE THAT HAND LEVER IS IN EXACT N (NEUTRAL) POSITION IN
TANK SHIFTER GUIDE.

(5) READJUST LENGTH OF SHIFTER ROD BY LOOSENING ROD END LOCK NUT, AND
TURNING ROD END (ONTO OR OFF ROD AS NECESSARY) UNTIL ITS BOLT HOLE
LINES UP WITH BOLT HOLE IN HAND LEVER.

(6) REPLACE BOLT AND TIGHTEN NUT.

(7) CHECK ADJUSTMENT. IT IS ADVISABLE TO SHIFT HAND LEVER INTO L
(LOW) AND S (SECOND) GEAR POSITIONS AND CHECK SHIFTER ROD ADJUSTMENT
TO BE SURE OF HAVING BEST ALLROUND ADJUSTMENT.

(8) WHEN SHIFTER CLUTCHES BECOME WORN OR DAMAGED TO THE EXTENT OF
JUMPING OUT OF ENGAGEMENT UNDER DRIVING LOAD, EVEN THOUGH SHIFTER
CONTROL LINKAGE IS CORRECTLY ADJUSTED, TRANSMISSION MUST BE REMOVED AND
REFERRED TO HIGHER AUTHORITY FOR SERVICE.

55. REPLACEMENT OF FOOT STARTER CRANK.

=A. REMOVE.=

(1) REMOVE STARTER CRANK CLAMP BOLT NUT AND REMOVE BOLT FROM CRANK.

(2) PULL STARTER CRANK OFF SQUARED SHAFT.

=B. INSTALL.= IN INSTALLING FOOT STARTER CRANK, NOTCH (FOR CLAMPBOLT
CLEARANCE) MUST BE IN UPWARD POSITION IN SQUARED SHAFT TO PUT RETURN
SPRING TENSION ON CRANK.

(1) USE A -INCH, OPENEND WRENCH AND TURN SQUARE SHAFT
COUNTERCLOCKWISE UNTIL BOLT SLOT IS UPWARD. HOLD SHAFT IN THIS POSITION
AND PRESS STARTER CRANK ONTO SHAFT UNTIL CLAMPING BOLT CAN BE INSERTED.

=A.= AT THE TIME FRONT CHAIN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE, INSPECT CHAIN FOR
CORRECT LUBRICATION AND, IF NECESSARY, ADJUST FRONT CHAIN OILER (PAR.
61).

=B.= CHAINS WEAR UNEVENLY AND SOME STRETCH MAY RESULT, MAKING TIGHT
AND LOOSE SECTIONS. FOR THIS REASON, ENGINE MUST BE TURNED AND CHAIN
ROTATED TO POSITION OF LEAST SLACK AT THE TIME ADJUSTMENT IS MADE.

=C.= A CORRECTLY ADJUSTED FRONT CHAIN HAS 1/2-INCH, OR SLIGHTLY MORE,
FREE UPANDDOWN MOVEMENT MIDWAY BETWEEN SPROCKETS, AT INSPECTION
HOLE. CHAIN MUST NEVER BE RUN TAUT (NO SLACK AT TIGHTEST POINT). CHAIN
MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO RUN LOOSE ENOUGH TO CAUSE JERKY, NOISY ACTION
AND/OR STRIKE THE CHAIN GUARD.

=D.= ADJUSTMENT OF FRONT CHAIN IS MADE BY SHIFTING TRANSMISSION ON ITS
MOUNTING BASE. THIS WILL AFFECT ADJUSTMENT OF GEAR SHIFTER CONTROL
LINKAGE, CLUTCH CONTROL LINKAGE, AND REAR CHAIN.

=E. HOW TO ADJUST FRONT CHAIN.=

(1) REMOVE INSPECTION HOLE COVER BY REMOVING SCREWS AND LIFTING COVER
FROM FRONT OUTER CHAIN GUARD, EXPOSING CHAIN (FIG. 36).

(2) OBTAIN TIGHTEST CHAIN POSITION BY ROTATING CHAIN TO POSITION OF
LEAST SLACK. TEST AMOUNT OF SLACK BY LIFTING AND DEPRESSING CHAIN WITH
FINGER. USE A FREE UPANDDOWN MOTION OF THE FINGER TO MAKE THIS TEST.

(3) LOOSEN THE THREE TRANSMISSION MOUNTING STUD NUTS UNDERNEATH
TRANSMISSION MOUNTING BASE. (IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DROP SKID PLATE
TO REACH STUD NUTS (FIG. 37).) TRANSMISSION CAN NOW BE SHIFTED ON ITS
MOUNTING BASE BY MEANS OF ADJUSTING SCREW, HEAD OF WHICH PROTRUDES

60. ADJUST REAR CHAIN AND ALINE REAR WHEEL (FIG. 39).

=A.= IN MOVING TRANSMISSION BACKWARD ON ITS MOUNTING TO TIGHTEN
FRONT CHAIN, THE REAR CHAIN WILL BE LOOSENED. REAR CHAIN MUST THEN
BE ADJUSTED BY MOVING REAR WHEEL BACKWARD. WHEN REAR WHEEL IS MOVED
EITHER FORWARD OR BACKWARD, ADJUSTMENT OF THE REAR WHEEL BRAKE IS
AFFECTED.

=B.= WHEN CHECKING REAR CHAIN FOR SLACK MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SPROCKETS,
TURN WHEEL AND ROTATE CHAIN TO POSITION OF LEAST SLACK. USE FREE
UPANDDOWN MOVEMENT OF FINGER TO LIFT CHAIN AND DEPRESS IT TO
DETERMINE TIGHTEST POSITION.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310236

FIGURE 39BRAKE SLEEVE NUT]

=C.= AT POSITION OF LEAST SLACK, A CORRECTLY ADJUSTED REAR CHAIN HAS
1/2-INCH, OR SLIGHTLY MORE, FREE UPANDDOWN MOVEMENT MIDWAY BETWEEN
SPROCKETS. CHAIN MUST NEVER BE RUN TAUT (NO SLACK AT TIGHTEST POINT).
CHAIN MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO RUN LOOSE ENOUGH TO CAUSE JERKY
OPERATION AND/OR STRIKE THE CHAIN GUARD OR OTHER CHASSIS PARTS.

=D.= AT THE TIME REAR CHAIN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE, INSPECT CHAIN FOR
CORRECT LUBRICATION AND IF NECESSARY, ADJUST REAR CHAIN OILER (PAR. 61).

=E.= REAR CHAIN ADJUSTMENT AND REAR WHEEL ALINEMENT ARE BOTH MADE BY
MEANS OF THE REAR WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREWS. THEREFORE, ADJUSTMENT OF
EITHER THE CHAIN OR THE WHEEL ALINEMENT CAN AFFECT ADJUSTMENT OF THE
OTHER, MAKING IT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER BOTH ADJUSTMENTS AT THE SAME
TIME.

(1) REMOVE REAR AXLE NUT AND LOCK WASHER (RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE).

(2) LOOSEN BRAKE SLEEVE NUT ENOUGH TO ALLOW BRAKE ASSEMBLY TO SLIDE
BACKWARD OR FORWARD IN FRAME MOUNTING (FIG. 39).

(3) LOOSEN THE TWO (RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE) REAR WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREW
LOCK NUTS.

(4) TURN WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREWS CLOCKWISE (TO RIGHT) TO MOVE WHEEL AND
SPROCKET BACKWARD. THIS TIGHTENS CHAIN. NOTE: IF CHAIN IS TOO TIGHT,
TURN WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREWS COUNTERCLOCKWISE (TO LEFT) SO THAT WHEEL
CAN BE SHIFTED FORWARD. THIS WILL LOOSEN CHAIN. ALWAYS TURN THE TWO
WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREWS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF TURNS IN ORDER TO KEEP WHEEL
ALINED.

(5) CHECK CORRECT ALINEMENT OF WHEEL BY NOTING THAT TIRE (NOT TIRE
RIM) RUNS APPROXIMATELY MIDWAY BETWEEN LOWER REAR FRAME TUBES AT THE
POINT WHERE TUBES JOIN TRANSMISSION MOUNTING. IT IS DESIRABLE TO HAVE
TIRE RUN SLIGHTLY CLOSER (NOT MORE THAN 1/16 IN.) TO RIGHT THAN TO
LEFT SIDE LOWER TUBE. A FURTHER CHECK OF ALINEMENT IS OBSERVING THAT
REAR SPROCKET RUNS CENTRALLY IN CHAIN. CAUTION: IF REAR WHEEL IS NOT
CORRECTLY ALINED, VEHICLE STEERING WILL BE AFFECTED, AND SPROCKETS WILL
WEAR EXCESSIVELY ON ONE SIDE.

(6) WITH ADJUSTMENT OF CHAIN AND WHEEL ALINEMENT COMPLETED, SECURELY
TIGHTEN WHEEL ADJUSTING SCREW LOCK NUTS, AND BRAKE SLEEVE NUT: REPLACE
AXLE LOCK WASHER AND NUT, TIGHTENING NUT.

(7) RECHECK ADJUSTMENT OF CHAIN AS TIGHTENING BRAKE SLEEVE NUT AND AXLE
NUT SOMETIMES CHANGES THE CHAIN ADJUSTMENT.

(8) AFTER TIGHTENING REAR CHAIN, REAR BRAKE MAY BE FOUND TOO TIGHT.
CHECK AND CORRECT BRAKE ADJUSTMENT (PAR. 96).

=61. CHAIN OILERS= (FIG. 40).

=A.= BOTH FRONT AND REAR CHAINS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LUBRICATED BY
ENGINE OIL PUMPS. CHAIN OILERS ARE ADJUSTABLE AND MAY NEED OCCASIONAL
READJUSTMENT TO MEET LUBRICATION REQUIREMENTS OF VARIED OPERATING
CONDITIONS. CHAINS UNDER MOST OPERATING CONDITIONS REQUIRE A VERY SMALL
AMOUNT OF OIL; THEREFORE, CHAIN OILERS REQUIRE VERY FINE ADJUSTMENT TO
SUPPLY JUST ENOUGH OIL WITHOUT WASTE.

=B.= WHEN ADJUSTING CHAIN OILERS, IT IS ADVISABLE TO ADD OR REMOVE ONLY
ONE THIN WASHER AT A TIME AND INSPECT CHAIN AGAIN AFTER VEHICLE HAS RUN
APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT FURTHER ADJUSTMENT
IS NECESSARY.

=C.= IF INSPECTION OF FRONT CHAIN THROUGH INSPECTION HOLE REVEALS THAT
CHAIN IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OIL, ADJUST FRONT CHAIN OILER AS FOLLOWS:

(1) ADD THIN (0.002-INCH THICK) WASHER UNDER HEAD OF FRONT CHAIN OILER
ADJUSTING SCREW (FIG. 40). DO NOT REMOVE ANY WASHERS ALREADY UNDER HEAD
OF SCREW.

(2) TO CHECK RESULTS, REFER TO STEP =B= ABOVE.

=D.= EVIDENCE OF TOO MUCH OIL ON FRONT CHAIN REQUIRES CUTTING DOWN ON
CHAIN OILER.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310237

FIGURE 40CHAIN OILERS]

(1) TO ADJUST OILER, REMOVE THIN (0.002-INCH THICK) WASHER FROM UNDER
HEAD OF FRONT CHAIN OILER ADJUSTING SCREW (FIG. 40).

(2) TO CHECK RESULTS, REFER TO STEP =B= ABOVE.

=E.= IF INSPECTION REVEALS THAT REAR CHAIN IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OIL,
AND THAT OIL PIPE END IS OPEN, IS NOT BENT, AND IS DIRECTED ON CHAIN;
THEN THE REAR CHAIN OILER MUST BE ADJUSTED.

(1) ADJUST OILER BY ADDING THIN (0.002-INCH THICK) WASHER UNDER HEAD OF
REAR CHAIN OILER ADJUSTING SCREW (FIG. 40). DO NOT REMOVE ANY WASHERS
ALREADY UNDER HEAD OF SCREW.

(2) TO CHECK RESULTS, REFER TO STEP =B= ABOVE.

=F.= EVIDENCE OF TOO MUCH OIL ON REAR CHAIN (SUPPLIED BY OILER)
REQUIRES CUTTING DOWN ON CHAIN OILER.

(1) TO ADJUST OILER, REMOVE THIN (0.002-INCH THICK) WASHER FROM UNDER
HEAD OF REAR CHAIN OILER ADJUSTING SCREW (FIG. 40).

(2) TO CHECK RESULTS, REFER TO STEP =B= ABOVE.

=G.= AT 1000-MILE INTERVALS, LOOSEN BOTH FRONT AND REAR CHAIN OILER
ADJUSTING SCREWS (FIG. 40) TWO TURNS EACH. DO NOT REMOVE SCREWS. START
AND IDLE ENGINE 1 MINUTE, THEN TIGHTEN SCREWS FIRMLY, BUT DO NOT FORCE.
THIS OPERATION SERVES TO FLUSH OILER CONTROL VALVES AND REAR CHAIN
OILER PIPE.

62. REPLACEMENT OF FRONT CHAIN.

=A.= A NEW OR ORIGINAL DUPLEX FRONT CHAIN IS ENDLESS, NOT PROVIDED WITH
CONNECTING LINK, AND ENGINE SPROCKET MUST BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO REMOVE
OR REPLACE CHAIN.

=B. REMOVE.=

67. GENERAL.

=A.= CARBURETOR IS OF THE SIDEOUTLET, PLAINTUBE TYPE WITH A FIXED
VENTURI. FUEL FEED IS BY GRAVITY FROM TANK ABOVE. CARBURETOR HAS
TWO MANUAL CONTROLS: THE THROTTLE, WHICH IS OPERATED BY THE RIGHT
HANDLE BAR GRIP, AND THE CHOKE, WHICH IS OPERATED BY A LEVER ON THE
CARBURETOR ITSELF. THE HIGH SPEED FUEL SUPPLY IS GOVERNED BY A FIXED
(NONADJUSTABLE) JET. THE IDLING TO MEDIUM SPEED (30 MPH) FUEL SUPPLY
IS GOVERNED BY AN ADJUSTABLE (LOW SPEED) NEEDLE VALVE LOCATED ON REAR
SIDE OF CARBURETOR BODY.

=68. CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT= (FIG. 43).

=A.= BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ADJUST CARBURETOR TO CORRECT FAULTY ENGINE
PERFORMANCE, ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN OTHER ITEMS WHICH HAVE A DIRECT
BEARING ON AND CAN AFFECT CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT AS WELL AS ENGINE
PERFORMANCE.

(1) INSPECT FUEL TANK CAP AND MAKE SURE AIR VENT IS NOT PLUGGED.

(2) SEE THAT THROTTLE CONTROL ADJUSTMENT IS CORRECT (PAR. 69).

(3) SEE THAT SPARK CONTROL ADJUSTMENT IS CORRECT (PAR. 88).

(4) DRAIN AND FLUSH CARBURETOR BOWL (PAR. 73).

(5) DRAIN AND FLUSH FUEL STRAINER (PAR. 72).

(6) INSPECT AIR CLEANER TO SEE THAT PASSAGE OF AIR THROUGH CLEANER
IS NOT RESTRICTED BY OIL LEVEL BEING TOO HIGH IN OIL CUP, OR BY AN
EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN FILTER ELEMENTS (PAR. 76).

(7) CHECK MANIFOLD PACKING NUTS AND CARBURETOR MOUNTING SCREWS FOR
TIGHTNESS.

(8) SEE THAT SPARK PLUGS ARE CLEAN AND THAT GAPS ARE ADJUSTED BETWEEN
0.025 INCH TO 0.030 INCH. IF CONDITION OF SPARK PLUGS IS QUESTIONABLE,
INSTALL NEW ONES.

(9) CHECK ADJUSTMENT OF VALVE TAPPETS (PAR. 43).

(10) CHECK COMPRESSION OF BOTH CYLINDERS (PAR. 29 B.) (1)

(11) CHECK CONDITION AND ADJUSTMENT OF CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS (PAR. 84).

(12) CHECK IGNITION TO BATTERY WIRING CONNECTIONS (DIAGRAM FIG. 48).

(13) SEE THAT BATTERY IS NOT ENTIRELY DISCHARGED BY TURNING ON LIGHTS
(TACTICAL SITUATION PERMITTING) AND OBSERVING BRILLIANCY.

=B.= A CARBURETOR, ONCE CORRECTLY ADJUSTED, SHOULD REQUIRE LITTLE, IF
ANY, READJUSTING. AT MOST, IT SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE LOW
SPEED NEEDLE MORE THAN ONE OR TWO NOTCHES EITHER WAY TO CORRECT MIXTURE
TO MEET CHANGES IN WEATHER CONDITIONS.

=C. LOW SPEED ADJUSTING NEEDLE= (FIGS. 43 AND 44). ADJUSTMENT OF THIS
NEEDLE VALVE CONTROLS ONLY IDLING AND LOW SPEED (UP TO APPROXIMATELY 30
MPH) FUEL MIXTURE. TURN NEEDLE VALVE DOWN (TO RIGHT) TO MAKE MIXTURE
LEANER. BACK OUT (TO LEFT) NEEDLE VALVE TO MAKE MIXTURE RICHER. NEEDLE
VALVE IS HELD IN ANY DESIRED POSITION BY A SPRINGANDBALL PLUNGER
WHICH ENGAGES NOTCHES IN THE NEEDLE ADJUSTING SCREW.

=D. COMPLETE READJUSTMENT OF CARBURETOR.= A CARBURETOR THAT IS BADLY
OUT OF ADJUSTMENT, AND/OR A NEW CARBURETOR JUST INSTALLED, MUST BE
ADJUSTED AS FOLLOWS:

(1) TURN THE LOW SPEED NEEDLE VALVE ALL THE WAY DOWN (TO RIGHT).

(2) BACK NEEDLE VALVE OUT (TO LEFT) ABOUT THREE FULL TURNS. WITH NEEDLE
VALVE IN THIS POSITION, ENGINE WILL START, BUT MIXTURE WILL PROBABLY BE
TOO RICH.

(3) START ENGINE AS FOLLOWS: AFTER CHOKE LEVER HAS BEEN MOVED TO NORMAL
OPEN RUNNING POSITION AND ENGINE IS NORMALLY HOT, CORRECT ADJUSTMENT
OF NEEDLE VALVE BY TURNING NEEDLE VALVE DOWN (TO RIGHT) ONE NOTCH AT A
TIME UNTIL MIXTURE BECOMES SO LEAN THAT ENGINE MISSES, AND IS INCLINED
TO STOP: THEN BACK OUT (TO LEFT) NEEDLE VALVE 5 TO 10 NOTCHES, OR UNTIL
ENGINE FIRES REGULARLY WITH SPARK ADVANCED AND THROTTLE CLOSED (OR AS
NEARLY CLOSED AS IT CAN BE SET AND STILL HAVE ENGINE RUNNING AT IDLING
SPEED).

(4) ADJUST THROTTLE LEVER STOP SCREW (FIG. 43) AS NECESSARY TO MAKE
ENGINE IDLE AT PROPER SPEED WITH THROTTLE IN FULLY CLOSED POSITION.
TURNING STOP SCREW TO THE RIGHT MAKES ENGINE IDLE FASTER. TURNING STOP
SCREW TO THE LEFT MAKES ENGINE IDLE SLOWER. DO NOT IDLE ENGINE AT THE
SLOWEST POSSIBLE SPEED, BECAUSE AN EXTREMELY SLOW IDLING ADJUSTMENT
CAUSES HARD ENGINE STARTING. CHANGING IDLING SPEED WITH THROTTLE STOP
SCREW IS LIKELY TO CHANGE THE LOW SPEED FUEL MIXTURE TO SOME EXTENT:
THEREFORE, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO AGAIN CHECK AND CORRECT THE LOW
SPEED NEEDLE VALVE ADJUSTMENT (STEP (3) ABOVE).

(5) ENGINE STARTING AND ALLROUND CARBURETION WILL BE IMPROVED WITH
LOW SPEED FUEL ADJUSTMENT SLIGHTLY RICH, RATHER THAN EXTREMELY LEAN.

=A.= CARBURETOR THROTTLE IS OPENED AND CLOSED BY MEANS OF THE RIGHT
HANDLE BAR GRIP, OPERATING A CONTROL WIRE (WITHIN A HOUSING) WHICH
CONNECTS TO THE THROTTLE LEVER. ADJUSTMENT FOR FULL OPENING AND CLOSING
OF THE THROTTLE TO CORRESPOND WITH FULL INWARD AND OUTWARD MOTION OF
THE HANDLE BAR GRIP IS MADE AT THE JUNCTION OF THE CONTROL WIRE END AND
THE THROTTLE LEVER CONNECTION.

=B. ADJUST FULLY CLOSED THROTTLE= (FIG. 43). SEE THAT THERE IS ABOUT
1 INCH DISTANCE BETWEEN END OF CONTROL WIRE HOUSING AND THROTTLE LEVER
WHEN IN FULLY CLOSED POSITION, SO THAT HOUSING END DOES NOT INTERFERE
WITH FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THROTTLE LEVER. IF ADJUSTMENT OF CONTROL WIRE
HOUSING IS NECESSARY, REFER TO PARAGRAPH 101. PROCEED WITH CLOSED
THROTTLE ADJUSTMENT.

(1) LOOSEN CONTROL WIRE CLAMP SCREW IN CONNECTOR BLOCK.

(2) TURN RIGHT HANDLE BAR GRIP OUTWARD AS FAR AS IT WILL GO: THEN
TURN IT INWARD SLIGHTLY. HOLDING THROTTLE GRIP IN THIS POSITION, MOVE
THROTTLE LEVER FORWARD AGAINST ITS STOP (CLOSED POSITION) AND SECURE
CONTROL WIRE IN CONNECTOR BLOCK WITH CLAMP SCREW. CHECK CLOSING OF
THROTTLE AFTER TIGHTENING CONTROL WIRE SET SCREW. IF NECESSARY, RESET
THE CONTROL WIRE IN THE CONNECTOR BLOCK UNTIL THROTTLE IS CLOSED WITH
FULL OUTWARD GRIP MOVEMENT.

=C. ADJUST FULLY OPEN THROTTLE= (FIG. 44). FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS UNDER
STEP =B= ABOVE, THEN:

(1) TURN RIGHT HANDLE BAR GRIP INWARD AS FAR AS IT WILL GO AND SEE THAT
THROTTLE LEVER IS AGAINST ITS STOP IN FULLY OPEN POSITION. IF THROTTLE
DOES NOT OPEN FULLY WHEN GRIP IS TURNED INWARD, RESET THE CONTROL WIRE
IN THE CONNECTOR BLOCK TO CORRECT THE ADJUSTMENT.

70. CARBURETOR REMOVAL.

EXHAUST PIPE ENDS ARE A SLIP FIT IN CYLINDER EXHAUST PORTS.

=76. AIR CLEANER= (FIGS. 46 AND 47).

=A. GENERAL.= AIR CLEANER SHOULD NOT BE SUBMERGED IN WATER, NOR
SHOULD HIGHPRESSURE STREAM BE DIRECTED INTO CLEANER LOUVERS (WHERE AIR
ENTERS ON REAR OF BODY) WHEN CLEANING VEHICLE. EITHER WATER OR DIRT
ENTERING AIR CLEANER IN EXCESSIVE QUANTITIES WILL RAISE THE OIL LEVEL
IN OIL CUP AND CHOKE OFF PROPER AIR SUPPLY TO CARBURETOR.

=B. SERVICE.= WITH VEHICLE IN NORMAL USE ON HARDSURFACED ROADS,
CLEAN AND REFILL AIR CLEANER OIL CUP WITH ENGINE OIL (SEASONAL GRADE)
AT LEAST EACH TIME ENGINE OIL TANK IS DRAINED AND REFILLED. CAUTION:
SERVICE MORE FREQUENTLY UNDER DUSTY CONDITIONS; DAILY UNDER EXTREMELY
DUSTY CONDITIONS. CHECK OIL SUPPLY DAILY.

=86. CIRCUIT BREAKER AND TIMER ASSEMBLY= (FIGS. 50 AND 51).

=A.= WHEN THE CIRCUIT BREAKER TIMER SHAFT AND BASE ASSEMBLY MUST BE
REPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE WEAR IN TIMER SHAFT BEARING, SHEARED WORM
GEAR PIN, AND/OR WORN OR DAMAGED WORM GEAR, ENGINE IGNITION MUST BE
RETIMED. IGNITION TIMING FOR THE VTYPE TWIN ENGINE IS DIFFICULT AND
SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED ONLY BY EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL.

=B. REMOVE= (FIG. 50). BEFORE THE TIMER SHAFT AND BASE ASSEMBLY CAN
BE REMOVED, THE CIRCUIT BREAKER TIMER HEAD ASSEMBLY MUST BE REMOVED.
NOTE: IF THE TIMER HEAD ONLY, OR TIMER WIRE, IS TO BE REPLACED, IT IS
NOT NECESSARY TO REMOVE TIMER SHAFT AND BASE ASSEMBLY, AND THUS THROW
ENGINE IGNITION OUT OF TIME.

(1) REMOVE TIMER HEAD COVER.

(2) UNLATCH COVER RETAINER ENDS FROM HOLES IN THE TIMER HEAD AND REMOVE.

(3) DISCONNECT SPARK CONTROL WIRE AT TIMER LEVER.

(4) LIFT THE TIMER HEAD ASSEMBLY OFF BASE. THE HEAD SEATING TENSION

(3) REMOVE PLUG FROM TIMING INSPECTION HOLE IN LEFTSIDE CRANKCASE.

(4) CONTINUE TURNING ENGINE SLOWLY UNTIL FLYWHEEL TIMING MARK IS IN
CENTER OF INSPECTION HOLE (FIG. 51). DO NOT TURN ENGINE FURTHER.

(5) INSTALL PAPER GASKET AND TIMER HEAD TENSION (GROUND) SPRING ON
TIMER SHAFT BASE ASSEMBLY. MAKE SURE BENT ENDS OF TENSION SPRING ARE
FACING DOWNWARD (AWAY FROM TIMER BASE).

(6) INSERT TIMER SHAFT AND BASE ASSEMBLY ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO PLACE IN
TIMING GEAR CASE COVER, TRYING TO LOCATE MARK ON SMALL END OF BREAKER
CAM IN POSITION SHOWN IN FIGURE 51. DO NOT INSTALL BASE MOUNTING SCREWS
AS YET.

(7) INSTALL TIMER HEAD ASSEMBLY SO THAT SPARK CONTROL LEVER IS WITHIN
THE ADVANCE AND RETARD QUADRANT (FIG. 51). NOTE: DO NOT INSTALL COVER
RETAINER UNTIL LATER.

(8) FULLY ADVANCE SPARK LEVER (PUSH INWARD TOWARD ENGINE) AND OBSERVE
HOW CLOSELY MARK ON BREAKER CAM LINES UP WITH BREAKER LEVER FIBER.
IF MARK DOES NOT LINE UP, LIFT TIMER BASE AND TURN SHAFT GEAR SO ITS
ENGAGEMENT WITH ITS DRIVING GEAR IS CHANGED ONE TOOTH. CHECK AGAIN
ACCORDING TO BREAKER CAM MARK AND BREAKER LEVER FIBER. REPEAT THIS
PROCEDURE UNTIL GEAR ENGAGEMENT IS OBTAINED WHICH CLOSELY ALINES CAM
MARK AND BREAKER LEVER FIBER.

(9) SEE THAT TIMER BASE IS TURNED SO THAT TIMER TO COIL WIRE IS TOWARD
REAR OF ENGINE.

(10) INSTALL TIMER BASE SCREWS AND LOCK WASHERS. MAKE SURE THAT TIMER
TO COIL WIRE SHIELDING IS GROUNDED UNDER HEAD OF SCREW FARTHEST AWAY
FROM ENGINE (FIG. 52). SECURELY TIGHTEN SCREWS.

(11) INSTALL TIMER HEAD ON BASE AND SECURE WITH GROUND SPRING AND COVER
RETAINER. BE SURE GROUND SPRING IS IN ITS PROPER PLACE SO THAT WHEN
COVER RETAINER ENDS ARE FITTED THROUGH HOLES IN THE TIMER HEAD, THEY
WILL ALSO FIT INTO SPRING LOCATING NOTCHES. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO
PRESS GROUND SPRING UPWARD UNDER TIMER BASE TO ENGAGE RETAINER ENDS
IN THE SPRING NOTCHES. NOTE: IF COVER RETAINER ENDS DO NOT ENGAGE
GROUND SPRING NOTCHES, SPRING WILL HAVE NO TENSION AND TIMER HEAD
WILL BE LOOSE ON ITS BASE. CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS AND CONDENSER ARE
ELECTRICALLY GROUNDED THROUGH TIMER BASE, AND GROUND SPRING HOLDS THE
HEAD AND BASE IN CLOSE CONTACT, THUS ASSURING A GOOD GROUND.

(12) CONNECT SPARK CONTROL WIRE AND TIMER LEVER AND ADJUST (PAR. 88).

(13) ENGINE IS NOW TIMED ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL FACTORY SETTING,
PROVIDING MARK ON SIDE OF TIMER HEAD AND HOLE IN HEAD ADJUSTING BAND
ARE STILL IN ALINEMENT, AND CIRCUIT BREAKER POINT GAP IS 0.022 INCH.
EVEN THOUGH ALL IGNITION TIMING MARKS ARE IN PERFECT ALINEMENT, AS
OUTLINED IN THE FOREGOING INSTRUCTIONS, IT IS ADVISABLE TO ACCURATELY
CHECK IGNITION TIMING (STEP =D= FOLLOWING).

=D. RECOMMENDED RECHECK OF IGNITION TIMING= (FIG. 51). EVEN THOUGH
ALL IGNITION TIMING MARKS ARE IN PERFECT ALINEMENT, AS WHEN ENGINE WAS
ORIGINALLY TIMED, IGNITION TIMING MAY CHANGE SOMEWHAT AFTER ENGINE HAS
BEEN IN SERVICE FOR A WHILE, DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND SEATING OF THE
VARIOUS MOVING PARTS THAT CAN AFFECT IGNITION TIMING. SINCE ACCURATE
IGNITION TIMING IS THE FIRST ESSENTIAL TO GOOD ENGINE PERFORMANCE, IT
IS ADVISABLE TO CHECK IGNITION TIMING ON NEW VEHICLE AFTER FIRST 1,500
MILES OF SERVICE, AND AT EACH 2,000 MILES THEREAFTER.

(1) SEE THAT CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CORRECT GAP OF
0.022 INCH (PAR. 84 =F=).

(2) ADVANCE TIMER LEVER FULLY (TOWARD ENGINE).

(3) TURN ENGINE IN DIRECTION IN WHICH IT RUNS UNTIL FRONT CYLINDER
IS ON COMPRESSION STROKE, AND CONTINUE TO TURN IT AHEAD SLOWLY UNTIL
NARROW TIMER CAM (THE END WITH THE TIMING MARK), JUST STARTS TO OPEN
THE CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 318205

FIGURE 52SHIELDING OF COIL TO TIMER WIRE GROUNDED ON BASE]

(4) AN ACCURATE TEST LIGHT CHECK AS TO WHEN POINTS JUST START TO BREAK
CAN BE MADE, USING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL RED LIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE.
DISCONNECT PANEL LIGHT WIRE FROM THE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH, ATTACHING
THIS WIRE TO THE INSULATED TERMINAL POST ON TIMER HEAD. TURN IGNITION
AND LIGHT SWITCH ON. AS LONG AS CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS ARE CLOSED,
LAMP WILL REMAIN LIT; AS POINTS START TO OPEN, LAMP WILL GO OUT. NOTE:
AFTER MAKING USE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL RED LIGHT FOR ABOVE PURPOSE,
RECONNECT WIRE TO OIL PRESSURE SWITCH.

(5) WHEN EXACT POSITION IS FOUND, WHERE POINTS JUST START TO OPEN,
FLYWHEEL MARK SHOULD BE IN THE CENTER OF THE INSPECTION HOLE.

(6) IF FLYWHEEL MARK IS NOT IN CENTER OF HOLE WHEN POINTS OPEN,
READJUST IGNITION TIMING AS NECESSARY (SLOWER OR FASTER) BY MEANS OF
THE TIMER HEAD AND BAND ADJUSTMENT.

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 318203

FIGURE 53SHIELDED COIL TO TIMER WIRE CORRECTLY CONNECTED AT COIL]

(7) TO READJUST TIMER HEAD, LOOSEN ADJUSTING BAND SCREW AND SHIFT
TIMER HEAD IN BAND. IF FLYWHEEL TIMING MARK SHOWS FORWARD OF CENTER
IN INSPECTION HOLE, THE TIMING IS SLOW. TO CORRECT, SHIFT TIMER HEAD
COUNTERCLOCKWISE AGAINST ROTATION OF BREAKER CAM. IF FLYWHEEL MARK IS
TO REAR OF CENTER OF INSPECTION HOLE, TIMING IS FAST AND TIMER HEAD
MUST BE SHIFTED WITH ROTATION (CLOCKWISE) OF BREAKER CAM, TO CORRECT
TIMING.

(8) WITH IGNITION TIMING CORRECT, FRONT CYLINDER PISTON IS 9/32 INCH
BEFORE TOP DEAD CENTER, ON COMPRESSION STROKE, WHEN CIRCUIT BREAKER
POINTS JUST START TO OPEN. AT THIS POINT SPARK OCCURS, IGNITING FRONT
CYLINDER FUEL CHARGE.

(9) INSTALL FLYWHEEL INSPECTION HOLE PLUG IN LEFT CRANKCASE.

=87. COIL TO TIMER WIRE= (FIGS. 52 AND 53).

=A.= MODELS PROVIDED WITH RADIO SHIELDING ARE IDENTIFIED BY S ON
EITHER SIDE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE COIL TO TIMER WIRE (LOWTENSION
WIRE) ON THESE MODELS IS SHIELDED FOR RADIO NOISE SUPPRESSION.

=B. REMOVE.=

(1) DISCONNECT BATTERY NEGATIVE GROUND WIRE AT FRAME CONNECTION.

(2) REMOVE THE TWO BOLTS WHICH SECURE UPPER END OF AIR CLEANER BRACKET
TO FRAME TUBE. SWING AIR CLEANER AND BRACKET OUTWARD AND FORWARD TO

(4) TEMPORARILY INSTALL FOOTBOARD ASSEMBLY AND OPERATE ENGINE, TO
OBSERVE WHETHER OR NOT GENERATOR IS CHARGING (GREEN SIGNAL LIGHT
GOES OFF AT ABOVE 20 MPH). IF CLEANING COMMUTATOR DOES NOT REMEDY
GENERATOR CHARGE, AND/OR COMMUTATOR IS BADLY WORN, THEN GENERATOR MUST
BE REPLACED (PAR. 93). IF CLEANING OF COMMUTATOR REMEDIED GENERATOR
CHARGE, REINSTALL GENERATOR END COVER, AND THE FOOTBOARD AND CLUTCH
PEDAL ASSEMBLY (PAR. 102 =B=).

=92. ARMATURE BEARING SPECIAL LUBRICATION= (FIG. 57).

=A.= AT THE 6,000-MILE SECOND ECHELON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICE
PERIOD, THE COMMUTATOR END BEARING MUST BE HANDPACKED. IN PERFORMING
THIS OPERATION, CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO SHIFT OR MOVE THE GENERATOR
THIRD (REGULATING) BRUSH, THUS DISTURBING GENERATOR CURRENT REGULATION.
GENERATOR DRIVE END BEARING IS ADEQUATELY LUBRICATED BY OIL CIRCULATING
THROUGH ENGINE.

=B. TO LUBRICATE COMMUTATOR END BEARING.=

(1) REMOVE LEFT FOOTBOARD, SIDEBAR, AND CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY,
FOLLOWING PROCEDURE OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 102 =A= (1) TO (6).

(2) REMOVE THE TWO END COVER SCREWS AND PULL END COVER OFF GENERATOR.

(3) REMOVE TWO OF THE THREE SCREWS WHICH SECURE THE OUTER GREASE
RETAINER PLATE TO END OF GENERATOR (FIG. 57).

(4) LOOSEN THE OTHER GREASE RETAINER PLATE SCREW SLIGHTLY TO PERMIT
SHIFTING PLATE TO ONE SIDE.

(6) SHIFT THE OUTER GREASE RETAINER PLATE BACK INTO POSITION. INSTALL
THE TWO SCREWS REMOVED, AND SECURELY TIGHTEN ALL THREE SCREWS.

(7) INSTALL GENERATOR END COVER AND THE TWO RETAINING SCREWS.

(8) INSTALL LEFT FOOTBOARD, SIDEBAR, AND CLUTCH FOOT PEDAL ASSEMBLY,
FOLLOWING PROCEDURE OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 102 =B=.

=93. REMOVE GENERATOR= (FIGS. 58 AND 59).

=A.= GENERATOR IS GEAR DRIVEN THROUGH ENGINE TIMING GEAR TRAIN.
GENERATOR CAN BE REMOVED AND INSTALLED WITHOUT REMOVING TIMING GEAR
CASE COVER, OR AFFECTING ALINEMENT OF TIMING GEARS.

=B.= BEFORE REPLACING GENERATOR BECAUSE OF FAILURE OF INSTRUMENT PANEL
GREEN SIGNAL LIGHT TO INDICATE CHARGE, CHECK PANEL LIGHT WIRING AND
BULB FOR GOOD CONDITION (PAR. 120).

=C.= WHEN IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT GENERATOR MUST BE REMOVED FOR
REPLACEMENT, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

(1) DISCONNECT WIRES FROM THE TWO GENERATOR TERMINALS MARKED SWITCH AND
RELAY.

(2) REMOVE THE TWO LONG SCREWS, THROUGH TIMING GEAR CASE COVER, THAT
SECURE END OF GENERATOR AGAINST GEAR CASE (FIG. 58).

(3) REMOVE STRAP NUT, LOCK WASHER, AND CURVED WASHER FROM END OF STRAP
THAT CLAMPS GENERATOR IN ITS CRADLE ON ENGINE CRANKCASE (FIG. 59).

[ILLUSTRATION: RA PD 310261

FIGURE 58REMOVING GENERATOR END MOUNTING SCREWS]

FIGURE 59REMOVING GENERATOR STRAP NUT]

(4) LIFT STRAP HIGH ENOUGH TO PERMIT RAISING GENERATOR SO THAT OIL
SLINGER (ON END OF GENERATOR GEAR) WILL CLEAR ADJACENT GEAR, AND ALLOW
GENERATOR TO BE REMOVED FROM ENGINE. BE SURE TO OBSERVE AND COUNT
NUMBER OF PAPER SHIMS BETWEEN GENERATOR AND CRADLE. LAY THESE SHIMS
ASIDE TO BE USED AGAIN WHEN GENERATOR IS REINSTALLED. ALSO, NOTE
LOCATION OF HOLE IN SHIMS FOR OIL DRAIN. THESE SHIMS WERE REQUIRED IN
ORIGINAL ASSEMBLY TO ADJUST DRIVING GEARS FOR PROPER MESH AND, IF LEFT
OUT, GEARS MAY MESH TOO DEEPLY AND HOWL, EVEN THOUGH CONSIDERABLY
WORN. UNLESS A NEW GENERATOR GASKET IS AVAILABLE, TO BE USED WHEN
GENERATOR IS REINSTALLED, BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE THE OLD ONE.

94. INSTALL GENERATOR.

=A.= WHEN INSTALLING GENERATOR, THE IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER IS
CORRECT SHIMMING OF GENERATOR IN ITS CRADLE TO PROVIDE CORRECT MESH OF
DRIVING GEAR WITH INTERMEDIATE TIMING GEAR. MAKE SURE SAME NUMBER OF
PAPER SHIMS ARE USED IN REASSEMBLING AS WERE FOUND UNDERNEATH GENERATOR
WHEN IT WAS REMOVED. AFTER AN ENGINE HAS BEEN RUN A CONSIDERABLE
LENGTH OF TIME AND GEARS HAVE WORN TO SOME EXTENT, THEY HAVE POSSIBLY
DEVELOPED SUFFICIENT LASH OR PLAY TO SAFELY REMOVE ONE OR MORE OF THE
ORIGINAL SHIMS, AND THUS AFFECT CLOSER MESHING AND QUIETER OPERATION.
HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD NOT BE DONE UNLESS TIMING GEAR CASE COVER IS
REMOVED SO THAT GEAR MESH AND LASH CAN BE CAREFULLY CHECKED.

TAKEN APART FOR ADJUSTMENT. BOTH WHEELS HAVE KNOCKOUT TYPE AXLES.

123. TIRES.

=A. DESCRIPTION.= WHEEL RIMS ARE OF THE DROPCENTER TYPE, HAVING A
DEPRESSION, OR WELL, IN CENTER OF RIM. THE RIM WELL, BEING SMALLER IN
CIRCUMFERENCE THAN THE REST OF THE RIM, ALLOWS ONE CASING BEAD TO FIT
LOOSELY IN IT WHILE OTHER BEAD IS BEING WORKED OVER EDGE OF RIM. BEAR
IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING ONE BEAD IN RIM WELL WHILE OTHER BEAD
IS BEING WORKED ONTO OR OFF RIM. NOTE: IT IS NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY TO
COMPLETELY REMOVE CASING FROM RIM. REMOVING ONE SIDE ONLY ALLOWS INNER
TUBE TO BE REMOVED AND REINSTALLED, AND ALSO ALLOWS INSIDE OF CASING TO
BE INSPECTED.

=B. REMOVE.=
