 FOOTNOTE:

 =*THESE CHANGES SUPERSEDE TB 3-376A-1, 19 OCTOBER 1944.=

=15. TRAINING.=

 * * * * *

B. USE OF WATER IN TRAINING. WATER MAY BE USED (INSTEAD OF FUEL)
FOR ELEMENTARY PRACTICE FIRING. IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE * * * PIECE,
AND LUBRICATED (PAR. 49). =USE OF WATER, HOWEVER, SHOULD ALWAYS BE
SUPPLEMENTED BY FIRING IGNITED FUEL BECAUSE WATER DOES NOT GIVE A
CORRECT IMPRESSION OF STREAM AND FLAME CHARACTERISTICS.=

 * * * * *

=17. CONNECTING TANK GROUP AND GUN GROUP.=

 * * * * *

A. PLACE THE NEW * * * TO 2 MINUTES. =SLIGHT PRESSURE SOMETIMES
BUILDS UP IN THE FUEL TANKS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE HAS
NOT BEEN OPENED, AND CAUSES SOME OVERFLOW OF FUEL WHEN THE COUPLING
PLUG IS REMOVED. THIS PRESSURE MAY BE RELIEVED BY=

 =(1) STANDING THE TANK GROUP UPRIGHT.=

 =(2) SLIGHTLY OPENING FILLING PLUG ON TOP OF FUEL TANKS TO
 BLEED THE PRESSURE.=

 =(3) CLOSING THE OPENING AT FILLING PLUG AND TIGHTENING IT
 WITH WRENCH.=

 * * * * *

=18. LOADING WITH IGNITION CYLINDER.=

 * * * * *

 B. PRECAUTIONS. CARE MUST BE * * * FRONT OF GUN. =DO NOT IGNITE
 THE IGNITION CARTRIDGE UNTIL THE WEAPON IS TO BE FIRED AT THE
 TARGET.=

 * * * * *

=30. AFTER FIRING.=

 WHEN THE FIRER * * * MISSION, HE SHOULD:

A. =FIRST=, REMOVE AND DISCARD THE IGNITION CYLINDER, =AS THE
IGNITION CYLINDER SHOULD NEVER BE PRESENT WHEN BLOWING OUT FUEL OR
AFTER BLOWING OUT FUEL EXCEPT WHEN PREPARING FOR A NEW MISSION. TO
REMOVE CYLINDER, PROCEED= AS FOLLOWS:

 * * * * *

B. CLOSE THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE BY TURNING VALVE HANDLE CLOCKWISE
(TO CONSERVE REMAINING PRESSURE IN PRESSURE TANK) =ONLY IF ADDITIONAL
SHOTS ARE TO BE FIRED BEFORE REFILLING AND RECHARGING=.

C. =IF NO ADDITIONAL SHOTS ARE TO BE FIRED BEFORE REFILLING
AND RECHARGING, OPEN PRESSURE-TANK VALVE BY TURNING HANDLE
COUNTERCLOCKWISE.= POINT THE GUN AWAY FROM PERSONNEL AND BLOW OUT THE
REMAINING FUEL =AND PRESSURE=, IF ANY, FROM THE FUEL TANKS BY SQUEEZING
THE VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY UNTIL THERE IS NO FURTHER DISCHARGE.
THE TRIGGER SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING THIS OPERATION. =THEN CLOSE THE
PRESSURE-TANK VALVE TO PREVENT ENTRANCE OF FOREIGN MATTER INTO THE
PRESSURE SYSTEM.=

D. (SUPERSEDED). CAREFULLY REMOVE TANK GROUP FROM THE BACK. THIS MAY
BE DONE MOST EASILY BY SITTING OR SQUATTING WITH BACK TO A TREE STUMP,
FLAT ROCK, PACKING BOX, OR OTHER OBJECT. RELEASE THE BODY AND SHOULDER
STRAPS AND EASE TANK GROUP OFF THE BACK. AVOID DROPPING EQUIPMENT ON
THE GROUND AS THIS MAY DAMAGE IT.

 * * * * *

=31. IGNITION CYLINDER.=

 * * * * *

C. PACKING. IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE * * * EACH FLAME THROWER. FIFTY
CANS (100 IGNITION CYLINDERS) ARE CONTAINED IN EACH =IGNITION CYLINDER=
PACKING BOX. =WOODEN PACKING BOX WITH CONTENTS WEIGHS APPROXIMATELY 50
TO 55 POUNDS. OUTSIDE DIMENSIONS OF THE BOX ARE APPROXIMATELY 16-1/4
INCHES BY 14-3/4 INCHES BY 10-1/4 INCHES. CUBAGE IS 1-3/12 CUBIC FEET.=

 * * * * *

=32. CHARGING PRESSURE TANK.=

 * * * * *

B. CHARGING FROM AIR COMPRESSOR. COMPRESSOR, AIR, GASOLINE * * *
CYLINDERS AS WELL. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE FOUND
IN =TM 3-377=.

 =FIGURE 23.= CHARGING TWO PRESSURE TANKS, USING CHARGING AND FILLING
 LINES, AND CYLINDERS OF COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN. =AS MANY AS FOUR
 PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES, ON OR OFF TANK GROUPS, CAN BE
 CHARGED AT ONE TIME FROM CYLINDERS COUPLED AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 24.=

=33. PRECAUTIONS WHEN PRESSURE-CHARGING.=

 * * * * *

M. (ADDED). INSPECT CAREFULLY TO BE CERTAIN THAT NO TRACES OF GREASE,
FLAME THROWER FUEL, OIL, DIRT, OR OTHER FOREIGN MATTER ARE PRESENT IN
FLAME THROWER PRESSURE TANKS, OUTLETS OF AIR COMPRESSOR, CONNECTIONS,
HOSE, OR CYLINDERS CONTAINING COMPRESSED AIR.

N. (ADDED). HANDS AND TOOLS MUST BE FREE OF OIL OR GREASE WHEN
CHARGING OR SERVICING FLAME THROWER PRESSURE SYSTEMS.

O. (ADDED). DISCHARGE ANY REMAINING COMPRESSED AIR IN FLAME THROWER
PRESSURE TANKS BEFORE RECHARGING.

P. (ADDED). IF COMPRESSED AIR IS TO BE USED, AND IF ANY GREASE, OIL,
OR FLAME THROWER FUEL IS DETECTED BY SENSE OF SMELL OR SIGHT WITHIN
PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES OR CYLINDERS, RETURN TANKS OR
CYLINDERS FOR CLEANING TO THE APPROPRIATE THIRD-ECHELON MAINTENANCE
AGENCY OF CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE.

=35.1 PEPTIZED FUELS= (ADDED).

A. CHARACTERISTICS.

(1) POUR MORE READILY THAN USUAL THICKENED FUELS.

(2) GIVE A LARGER DIAMETER FLAME THAN THICKENED FUELS.

(3) GIVE LONGER EFFECTIVE RANGES THAN LIQUID FUELS.

(4) PREPARED MORE QUICKLY IN COOL TEMPERATURES THAN THICKENED FUELS.

B. PREPARATION.

(1) OPEN 5-1/4-POUND CAN OR CANS OF THICKENER.

(2) ADD 2 MESS KIT SPOONFULS OF WATER TO EACH CAN OF THICKENER. STIR
UNTIL THE WATER DISAPPEARS IN THE THICKENER. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO MIX
THE WATER UNIFORMLY WITH ALL OF THE THICKENER.

(3) PROCEED AT ONCE AS DIRECTED IN PARAGRAPH 35. AVOID ACCIDENTAL
ADDITION OF ANY WATER TO THE THICKENER OR FUEL OTHER THAN THAT STATED
IN (2) ABOVE.

(4) PEPTIZED FUELS SET A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY THAN THE USUAL THICKENED
FUELS, BUT THEIR GENERAL APPEARANCE AFTER SETTING IS THE SAME. AFTER
STANDING, HOWEVER, PEPTIZED FUELS SPONTANEOUSLY BECOME THINNER AND
MAY BE POURED WITHOUT USE OF PRESSURE. THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THINNING
TO OCCUR DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE FUEL. AT 75 FAHRENHEIT OR
HIGHER, THINNING OCCURS IN APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 2 HOURS. AT TEMPERATURES
BELOW 60 FAHRENHEIT, THINNING OCCURS SEVERAL DAYS AFTER PREPARATION OF
THE PEPTIZED FUEL.

(5) IF WATER HAS ACCIDENTALLY GOTTEN INTO FUEL BEFORE ADDITION OF
THE THICKENER, PEPTIZING ACTION TAKES PLACE, BUT THE RESULTS ARE
UNPREDICTABLE BECAUSE THE QUANTITY OF WATER ADDED IS NOT CONTROLLED.

=36. PREPARATION OF LIQUID FUELS.=

A. CHOICE OF INGREDIENTS. THIN FUELS ARE * * * REACHING THE TARGET.
FOR THIS REASON, LIQUID FUELS SHOULD CONTAIN THE LOWEST PROPORTION OF
GASOLINE AND THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF HEAVIER FUELS THAT PERMIT EASY
IGNITION. IN HOT CLIMATES, * * * OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. =THE GASOLINE
USED CAN BE ANY U. S. GRADE OF MOTOR FUEL OR AVIATION GASOLINE.=
SUITABLE BLENDS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

 * * * * *

(3) (ADDED). BY VOLUME, 20 TO 25 PERCENT GASOLINE AND 75 TO 80 PERCENT
LIGHT FUEL OIL.

 * * * * *

=40.1 USE OF PACKBOARDS= (ADDED).

DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES (PAR. 66.1) MAKE POSSIBLE
THE USE OF PACKBOARDS FOR TRANSPORTING PRESSURE TANKS, 5-GALLON
CANS OF FUEL, WRENCHES, AND ADDITIONAL IGNITION CYLINDERS CLOSE TO THE
FRONT LINE OF COMBAT TO TROOPS USING FLAME THROWERS. AS PACKBOARDS
ARE NOT MANUFACTURED SPECIFICALLY FOR SERVICING FLAME THROWERS, STANDARD
QUARTERMASTER-ISSUE PACKBOARDS ARE USED. PACKBOARD TRANSPORTATION
IS PRACTICABLE ONLY WITH POURABLE FUEL. (POURABLE FUELS INCLUDE
SOME THICKENED FUELS AND ALL LIQUID FUELS.)

A. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUGGESTED PROCEDURE FOR PACKBOARD
TRANSPORTATION:

(1) LASH ALL NECESSARY FILLING AND CHARGING SUPPLIES FOR ONE FLAME
THROWER TO PACKBOARD, USING LASHING ROPE AND STRAPS.

(2) TIE ONE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY TO TOP OF ONE FLAT 5-GALLON
FUEL CAN SO THAT FLEXIBLE SHAFT AND HANDLE HANG DOWN PARALLEL TO
ONE SIDE OF THE FUEL CAN.

(3) CARRY WRENCH WITH LARGE ENOUGH OPENING TO UNSCREW FILLING
PLUGS FROM TOPS OF FUEL TANKS AND TO TIGHTEN PLUGS AFTER FILLING.

(4) CARRY EXTRA IGNITION CYLINDERS.

B. RETURN EMPTY PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY ALONG WITH EMPTY
FUEL CAN AND WRENCH ON PACKBOARD TO FLAME THROWER SERVICING POINT.

C. IF A SUPPLY OF FLAME THROWER TANK GROUPS IS AVAILABLE, THEY MAY
BE PREFERRED TO THE PACKBOARD METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION. TANK
GROUPS ARE EASY TO CARRY, AND A FILLED AND CHARGED TANK GROUP CAN
REPLACE AN EMPTIED ONE AS QUICKLY AS PACKBOARD METHOD CAN BE USED TO
SERVICE FLAME THROWER.

=66.1 DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES= (ADDED).

NEWLY DEVELOPED DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES PROVIDE
AN IMPROVED AND SPEEDIER METHOD OF SERVICING M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME
THROWERS IN FORWARD COMBAT ZONES.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING.

(1) DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES (FIGS. 35.2 AND
35.3) ARE USED IN MODIFIED FLAME THROWERS. THEY MAKE IT UNNECESSARY TO
REPLACE EMPTY COMPLETE TANK GROUPS WITH FILLED AND CHARGED COMPLETE
TANK GROUPS.

(2) REPLACEMENT OF COMPLETE TANK GROUP, HOWEVER, MAY BE PREFERRED WHEN
AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF TANK GROUPS IS AVAILABLE, OR IF THICKENED FUEL IS
TOO STRINGY AND VISCOUS TO POUR.

(3) DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES CAN BE ATTACHED ONLY
TO FLAME THROWERS WHICH INCLUDE SOCKETS (FIGS. 35.2 AND 35.3) AND
SHORTENED REGULATOR TUBES. FLAME THROWERS PRODUCED RECENTLY INCLUDE
THIS DESIGN MODIFICATION.

(4) A PLUG AND CAP (FIG. 35.3) ON DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE
ASSEMBLY REPLACE TUBE ELBOW (FIG. 33) USED ON NONDETACHABLE PRESSURE
TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY.

B. REMOVAL. CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO CONNECTIONS
DURING REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION. THE PROCEDURE FOR REMOVAL OF PRESSURE
TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY IS AS FOLLOWS:

(1) CLOSE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. PRESS VALVE LEVER AND SAFETY GRIP ON GUN
TO RELEASE ALL PRESSURE FROM FUEL SYSTEM AND GUN.

(2) UNSCREW WING NUT FROM VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT. (SEE FIG. 35.4.) BE
CAREFUL NOT TO MISPLACE WING NUT.

(3) PULL CLAMP AND SHAFT FROM STUD WHICH IS WELDED ON FUEL TANK.

(4) WITH ONE HAND UNDER PRESSURE TANK, UNCLAMP BUT DO NOT FULLY OPEN
PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP.

(5) SUPPORTING PRESSURE TANK VALVE WITH TOP OF RIGHT HAND, PUSH KNURLED
SOCKET IN AND AWAY FROM PRESSURE TANK VALVE. LEFT HAND MAY BE PLACED
AT BACK OF REGULATOR TUBE SO THAT TUBE DOES NOT BEND AWAY FROM SOCKET.
(SEE FIG. 35.5.) PULL OUT PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY.

INTRODUCTION

SECTION I GENERAL

1. SCOPE.

A. ARRANGEMENT. THIS MANUAL IS PUBLISHED TO GUIDE AND INFORM
PERSONNEL USING AND MAINTAINING FLAME THROWER, PORTABLE, M2-2. PART ONE
CONTAINS GENERAL INFORMATION; PART TWO IS A GUIDE TO OPERATION; PART
THREE GIVES MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THE APPENDIX DISCUSSES SHIPMENT AND
STORAGE PROCEDURES, AND APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS.

B. REFERENCES. REFERENCES ARE LISTED IN THE APPENDIX. THE
LIST INCLUDES FIELD MANUALS, TECHNICAL MANUALS, AND ARMY REGULATIONS.

2. RECORDS.

ALTHOUGH NO STANDARD MAINTENANCE FORMS AND RECORDS ARE FURNISHED,
AN IMPROVISED LIST SHOULD BE KEPT OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES EACH FLAME
THROWER HAS BEEN FIRED. THE LIST INDICATES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO
PROVIDE THE AFTER-SIX-MISSIONS PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE AND LUBRICATION.
IT SHOULD BE TACKED OR GLUED TO THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE PACKING-CHEST
LID AND EACH FLAME THROWER SHOULD ALWAYS BE RETURNED TO ITS OWN CHEST.

SECTION II DESCRIPTION AND DATA

3. USES OF FLAME THROWERS.

FLAME THROWERS CAN:

A. PENETRATE OPENINGS, SUCH AS EMBRASURES
AND GUN PORTS, AND FILL THE FORTIFICATIONS WITH FLAME AND
SMOKE.

B. BURN, ASPHYXIATE, AND BLIND ENEMY PERSONNEL, CAUSING CASUALTIES,
SHOCK, PANIC, AND ABANDONMENT OF A FORTIFIED POSITION.

C. IGNITE COMBUSTIBLE PARTS OF SHELTERS AND MATERIEL AND START
DETONATION OF SENSITIVE AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 2. FIRING WITH LIQUID FUEL.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 3. FIRING WITH THICKENED FUEL. THICKENED FUEL
HAS LONGER RANGE THAN LIQUID FUEL AND BURNS ON TARGET FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES.]

D. SHOOT AROUND CORNERS, WHEN FUEL IS FIRED FROM DEAD OR
BLIND ANGLES. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE BILLOWING AND SWIRLING
MOVEMENTS OF FLAMING GASES. BLAZING THICKENED FUELS ALSO
RICOCHET FROM WALL TO WALL IN FORTIFICATIONS.

E. CAUSE THE ENEMY TO CLOSE PORTS, TEMPORARILY PUTTING THE EMPLACEMENT
OUT OF ACTION AND THUS PROTECTING THE DEMOLITION PARTY.

F. MOP UP DUG-IN PERSONNEL.

G. ELIMINATE ENEMY NESTS IN STREET OR JUNGLE FIGHTING.

4. CHARACTERISTICS AND EMPLOYMENT.

A. ACTION. FUEL IS PROPELLED INTO THE TARGET BY A CHARGE OF
HIGHLY COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN. AS FUEL LEAVES THE GUN OF THE
M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER (FIG 1), IT IS IGNITED BY CONTACT WITH
FLAME FROM CHARGES OF INCENDIARY MIX HELD IN AN EXPENDABLE IGNITION
CYLINDER.

B. BURSTS. A CONTINUOUS STREAM OR SEPARATE BURSTS MAY BE
FIRED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 9 SECONDS, NOT INCLUDING TIME BETWEEN
THE BURSTS. THE FIVE INCENDIARY CHARGES IN THE IGNITION CYLINDER
ARE CONTROLLED BY THE TRIGGER AND CAN IGNITE SEVERAL BURSTS.

C. RANGE. PORTABLE FLAME THROWERS ARE FIRED AT EXTREMELY
CLOSE OR POINT-BLANK RANGE FOR BEST RESULTS. (PAR 22) EFFECTIVE
RANGE FOR LIQUID FUELS (FIG 2) IS AS FAR AS 20 YARDS, AND FOR THICKENED
FUELS (FIG 3), 40 YARDS, BUT UNDERBRUSH AND ADVERSE WINDS
CAN REDUCE THE DISTANCES.

D. WEIGHT. TO KEEP THE WEIGHT AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND STILL
PROVIDE STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND VERY HIGH PRESSURES, MOST PARTS
ARE MADE OF ALUMINUM OR SHEET STEEL.

E. TACTICS. TWO OR MORE FLAME THROWERS ARE GENERALLY USED
ON A MISSION WITH OTHER WEAPONS OF THE ASSAULT SQUAD. (SEE FM
31-50, ATTACK ON A FORTIFIED POSITION AND COMBAT IN TOWNS.)

F. FIRERS AND ASSISTANTS. ONE MAN CARRIES AND FIRES EACH
FLAME THROWER. WELL-ARMED ASSISTANTS ACCOMPANY FIRERS TO GIVE
CLOSE PROTECTION AND TO SERVE AS EMERGENCY REPLACEMENTS.
WHEREAS THE M1A1 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER MAY REQUIRE THE HELP
OF AN ASSISTANT TO OPEN THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE, THE M2-2 FLAME
THROWER PRESSURE-TANK VALVE IS LOCATED WITHIN REACH OF THE FIRER
AND IS OPERATED BY HIM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. FIRERS AND ASSISTANTS
SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY TRAINED IN OPERATION OF THE WEAPON.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 4. TANK GROUP.]

G. CHARGING AND FILLING. IN ORDER TO REPLACE PRESSURE TANKS
(CYLINDERS) OF EARLIER TYPES OF FLAME THROWERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO
UNSCREW AND SCREW THREADED CONNECTIONS. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THIS
FREQUENTLY RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THREADS, LEAKAGE, LOSS OF PRESSURE,
AND LOSS OF RANGE. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO USE TOOLS TO REPLACE
EACH PRESSURE TANK (CYLINDER). THE DESIGN OF THE M2-2 FLAME THROWER
ELIMINATES THESE DIFFICULTIES. THE TANK GROUP (FIG 4) MAY BE CHARGED
AND FILLED AS A UNIT WITH OR WITHOUT GUN AND HOSE. THE QUICK-CONNECTING
TANK COUPLING PERMITS RAPID INTERCHANGING OF EMPTY AND FULL TANK GROUPS
BY THE FIRERS OR ASSISTANTS. THIS IS DONE WITHOUT TOOLS, TAKES VERY
LITTLE TIME, AND CANNOT CAUSE LEAKAGE, LOSS OF PRESSURE, AND LOSS OF
RANGE DUE TO DAMAGED THREADS.

5. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING.

THE FLAME THROWER CONSISTS OF TWO MAJOR GROUPS: TANK GROUP AND
GUN GROUP. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF ASSEMBLIES AND PARTS ARE
INCLUDED IN PARAGRAPHS 66 THROUGH 76.

A. TANK GROUP. (FIGS 4 AND 5) CARRIED UPON THE FIRERS BACK,
THE TANK GROUP HOLDS FUEL AND PRESSURE. THE TANK GROUP MAY BE
IDENTIFIED AS TANK, FUEL, PORTABLE FLAME THROWER, M2, ASSEMBLY
D81-1-482. IT CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF:

(1) TWO FUEL TANKS, HOLDING A TOTAL OF 4 GALLONS OF FUEL, AND
JOINED BY A TANK CONNECTOR TO FORM A SINGLE FUEL RESERVOIR.

(2) PRESSURE TANK, CHARGED WITH HIGHLY COMPRESSED AIR OR
NITROGEN USED TO PROPEL FUEL FROM THE FUEL TANKS THROUGH THE GUN
TO THE TARGET. THE TANK IS LARGE IN CAPACITY TO ASSURE AMPLE PRESSURE
AND UNIFORMLY LONG RANGE THROUGHOUT THE FIRING.

(3) PRESSURE-TANK VALVE, WHICH RELEASES AIR OR NITROGEN
THROUGH THE PRESSURE REGULATOR TO THE FUEL TANKS. THE VALVE CAN
BE OPENED BY THE FIRER WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED IN THE CASE
OF THE M1A1 FLAME THROWER.

(4) PRESSURE REGULATOR, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ASSURES DELIVERY
OF AIR OR NITROGEN TO THE FUEL TANKS AT THE PROPER PRESSURE. THE
REGULATOR IS LOCATED IN A POSITION WHERE IT CANNOT EASILY BE DAMAGED.

(5) CARRIER, WHICH SUPPORTS THE TANK GROUP ON THE FIRERS BACK
AND SHOULDERS AND SECURES IT TO HIS BODY. IT INCLUDES BODY AND
SHOULDER STRAPS AND QUICK-RELEASING FASTENERS.

B. GUN GROUP. (FIG 6) CARRIED, AIMED, AND OPERATED BY THE
HANDS OF THE FIRER, THE GUN GROUP IGNITES THE FUEL AND DIRECTS THE
FLAME INTO THE TARGET. IT INCLUDES:

(1) FUEL HOSE, WHICH CONVEYS FUEL FROM THE TANK GROUP TO THE
GUN. THE FUEL HOSE MAY BE REQUISITIONED AS HOSE, FUEL, PORTABLE
FLAME THROWER, M1, ASSEMBLY B81-1-498.

(2) GUN, WHICH IGNITES THE FUEL AND DIRECTS IT TO THE TARGET.
THE GUN MAY BE IDENTIFIED AS GUN, PORTABLE FLAME THROWER,
M2, ASSEMBLY D81-1-405. IT CONSISTS OF:

(A) FUEL VALVE, WHICH DISCHARGES FUEL THROUGH THE BARREL.
THE VALVE IS OPERATED BY SQUEEZING THE VALVE LEVER AND THE GRIP
SAFETY, WHICH ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE VALVE GRIP. THE VALVE
ALSO INCLUDES A BARREL FROM WHICH THE FUEL IS EJECTED. THE IGNITION
HEAD IS SUPPORTED ON THE FRONT OF THE BARREL.

(B) IGNITION HEAD, WHICH IGNITES THE FUEL AS IT PASSES
FROM THE NOZZLE OF THE BARREL. WITH EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER ON THE
FRONT GRIP, ONE OF FIVE CHARGES OF INCENDIARY MIX IN AN IGNITION
CYLINDER IS IGNITED. THIS PILOT FLAME IGNITES THE FUEL AS IT IS
PROPELLED FROM THE GUN.

CONSTRUCTION.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 6. GUN GROUP OF PORTABLE FLAME THROWER M2-2.]

6. IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.

THE WORDS CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE, MODEL NUMBERS, SERIAL
NUMBERS, LOT NUMBERS, WEIGHT, CUBAGE, MANUFACTURERS NAMES,
CONTRACT NUMBER, AND DATE OF PACKING ARE INDICATED ON THE PACKING
CHEST OR THE EQUIPMENT. THE NUMBERS AND LETTERS SHOWN ON THE
EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE REFERRED TO WHEN REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED. THE
TANK GROUP AND THE GUN (WITHOUT THE FUEL HOSE) MAY EACH BE MARKED
M2 AND THE FUEL HOSE MAY BE MARKED M1, ALTHOUGH ALL OF
THESE ARE COMPONENTS OF THE M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER.

7. DIFFERENCES IN MODELS.

A. M2-2 AND E3 PORTABLE FLAME THROWERS. PORTABLE FLAME
THROWER M2-2 IS IDENTICAL IN ALL IMPORTANT RESPECTS WITH PORTABLE
FLAME THROWER E3. (THE E3 FLAME THROWER, WHEN STANDARDIZED
WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS, BECAME THE M2-2.) OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
OF THE M2-2 AND E3 ARE IN GENERAL THE SAME, AND THE PARTS
ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.

B. M2-2, M1, AND M1A1 PORTABLE FLAME THROWERS. PORTABLE
FLAME THROWER M2-2 HAS THE SAME FUEL CAPACITY BUT DIFFERS IN
CONSTRUCTION FROM PORTABLE FLAME THROWERS M1 AND M1A1. PARTS
ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE EXCEPT AS STATED IN PARAGRAPH 8.

8. INTERCHANGING PARTS WITH M1 OR M1A1 FLAME THROWER.

TO USE AN M2-2 GUN WITH TANK GROUP (FUEL UNIT) OF AN M1 OR M1A1
PORTABLE FLAME THROWER:

A. REMOVE FUEL HOSE FROM M2-2 GUN.

B. SCREW A 3/4-INCH BY 1/2-INCH PIPE BUSHING INTO THE SIDE
OPENING OF THE FUEL-VALVE BODY. THIS BUSHING IS FURNISHED IN THE
SPARE PARTS KIT OF EACH M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER. (PAR 10)

C. SCREW THE FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY OF THE M1 OR M1A1 FLAME
THROWER INTO THE 1/2-INCH OPENING OF THE BUSHING, USING A WRENCH

I. COMPARE CONTENTS WITH PACKING LIST FOUND IN OR ON PACKING CHEST.
INSPECT ALL CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR COMPLETENESS, CORRECT ADJUSTMENT,
AND GOOD CONDITION.

J. INSERT DEFLECTOR TUBE IN SAFETY HEAD ON LEFT FUEL TANK. (FIG 11)
OUTLET SHOULD FACE TO REAR AND AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE TO OPERATORS LEFT
SHOULDER. (FIG 18) SCREW IN DEFLECTOR TUBE BY HAND; DO NOT USE WRENCH
ON DEFLECTOR TUBE. TIGHTEN LOCK NUT WITH WRENCH.

K. BEFORE USE ON A MISSION, TEST-FIRE THE WEAPON. (PAR 56 B)

L. SAVE THE PACKING CHEST FOR STORAGE OF THE EQUIPMENT WHEN FLAME
THROWER IS NOT BEING CARRIED ON A FIRING MISSION OR SERVICED.

13. USED EQUIPMENT.

WHEN THEY APPLY, THE SAME STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS IN PARAGRAPH 12. ANY
WORN OR DAMAGED PARTS SHOULD BE REPLACED. AREAS WHERE PAINT HAS WORN
OFF SHOULD BE TOUCHED UP WITH FRESH PAINT.

SECTION VI CONTROLS

14. CONTROLS.

THE FIRER USES THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE HANDLE, THE TRIGGER, AND THE
VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY (FIG 12) IN SUCCESSION AS FOLLOWS:

A. VALVE HANDLE. THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE IS OPERATED BY TURNING
A HANDLE ON THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT WITHIN REACH OF THE FIRER.
COUNTERCLOCKWISE OPERATION OF HANDLE RELEASES PRESSURE TO THE
FUEL TANKS. CLOCKWISE TURNING CLOSES THE VALVE.

B. TRIGGER. THE TRIGGER IS AT THE FRONT GRIP OF THE GUN. PULLING
THE TRIGGER VIGOROUSLY IGNITES AN INCENDIARY CHARGE IN THE IGNITION
CYLINDER. THIS IN TURN IGNITES THE FUEL AS IT LEAVES THE GUN. THE
TRIGGER ACTION ALSO CAUSES THE IGNITION CYLINDER TO REVOLVE ONE-FIFTH
OF A TURN, PRESENTING ANOTHER CHARGE FOR FIRING. EACH OF THE
FIVE CHARGES MAY THUS BE USED IN RAPID SUCCESSION, IF NECESSARY,
BY PULLING THE TRIGGER VIGOROUSLY AS MANY AS FIVE TIMES.

C. VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY. THE VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY
ARE MOUNTED ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE VALVE GRIP OF THE GUN. WHEN
BOTH CONTROLS ARE COMPRESSED, FUEL IS PROPELLED FROM THE GUN. IF
EITHER THE VALVE LEVER OR THE GRIP SAFETY IS NOT COMPRESSED, THE
FUEL VALVE REMAINS CLOSED AND THE FUEL REMAINS IN THE WEAPON.

SECTION VII OPERATION UNDER USUAL CONDITIONS

15. TRAINING.

EFFECTIVE USE OF THE M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY
BY DILIGENT PRACTICE WITH THE WEAPON. UNTRAINED FIRERS OR ASSISTANTS
SHOULD NEVER BE SENT ON A MISSION.

A. PRACTICE. FIRERS SHOULD PRACTICE UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS OF
WIND, RANGE, ELEVATION, DEPRESSION, AND TRAVERSE. THE SHORTNESS OF THE
TOTAL FIRING TIME (APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 9 SECONDS) DEMANDS SPLIT-SECOND
JUDGMENT AND COORDINATION.

B. USE OF WATER IN TRAINING. WATER MAY BE USED (INSTEAD OF FUEL) FOR
ELEMENTARY PRACTICE FIRING. IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE NOT USED WITH WATER.
THE WATER UNDER PRESSURE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO PERSONNEL AT 10
YARDS. AFTER PRACTICE WITH WATER, THE GUN SHOULD BE DISASSEMBLED (PARS
73 THROUGH 76), CLEANED AND DRIED PIECE BY PIECE, AND LUBRICATED. (PAR
49)

C. USE OF FUEL IN TRAINING. WHEN USING FUEL IN TRAINING, SELECT OR
PREPARE A PRACTICE FIELD OF FIRE WHICH PROVIDES AT LEAST 125 YARDS FOR
RANGE AND 30 YARDS FOR SPREAD. IF THE FIELD CONTAINS DRY GRASS, BRUSH,
OR OTHER FLAMMABLE MATERIAL, A FIRE-FIGHTING SQUAD SHOULD BE AVAILABLE
WITH EQUIPMENT AND SOURCE OF WATER. ASSISTANTS AND OBSERVERS SHOULD
STAY WELL BEHIND THE FIRER BECAUSE OF DANGER FROM WIND SHIFTS. SEE
PARAGRAPH 40 FOR ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS.

16. CHARGING, FILLING, AND SERVICING.

BEFORE USE ON MISSIONS OR FOR TRAINING, FLAME THROWERS MUST BE CHARGED,
FILLED, AND SERVICED. CHARGING WITH COMPRESSED AIR OR COMPRESSED
NITROGEN IS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS 32 AND 33; FILLING WITH FUEL IN
PARAGRAPHS 34 THROUGH 40; AND SERVICING IN PARAGRAPHS 50 THROUGH 56.
TEST FOR PRESSURE. (PAR 53 D)

17. CONNECTING TANK GROUP AND GUN GROUP.

IF A CHARGED AND FILLED TANK GROUP HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP TO REPLACE AN
EMPTIED ONE:

A. PLACE THE NEW TANK GROUP ON THE GROUND WITH THE TANK COUPLING ON
TOP. IF THE FILLING IS THICKENED FUEL, ALLOW THE TANK GROUP TO REST IN
THIS POSITION FOR FROM 1 TO 2 MINUTES.

B. REMOVE COUPLING PLUG FROM NEW TANK GROUP AND DISCONNECT GUN GROUP
FROM EMPTIED TANK GROUP. PLACE UNTHREADED END OF FUEL HOSE IN TANK
COUPLING AND LOCK IN PLACE. (PAR 70)

C. LOCK THE COUPLING PLUG IN THE EMPTIED TANK GROUP.

18. LOADING WITH IGNITION CYLINDER.

A. GENERAL. JUST BEFORE THE START OF A MISSION, LOAD AN UNUSED
IGNITION CYLINDER INTO THE IGNITION HEAD. (M1 AND E1 IGNITION CYLINDERS
ARE IDENTICAL AND MAY BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY.) CYLINDERS ARE PACKED
TWO TO A CAN. DO NOT OPEN CANS UNTIL READY TO LOAD FOR A MISSION. THE
SECOND CYLINDER IN THE CAN SHOULD BE USED IN ANOTHER FLAME THROWER ON
THE SAME MISSION OR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER OPENING THE CAN. PARTLY
USED CYLINDERS MAY BE EMPLOYED IN TRAINING.

B. PRECAUTIONS. CARE MUST BE TAKEN, WHENEVER CYLINDERS ARE HANDLED,
TO AVOID ANY BLOWS OR PRESSURE AGAINST THE METAL MATCH ENDS. (FIG 13)
FACE, HANDS, AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY SHOULD NEVER BE EXPOSED TO
FRONT OF CYLINDER OR FRONT OF GUN.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 13. IGNITION CYLINDER BEFORE USE.]

C. PROCEDURE. LOADING PROCEDURE IS AS FOLLOWS:

(1) UNSCREW AND REMOVE IGNITION SHIELD. (FIG 14)

(2) PLACE IGNITION CYLINDER ON END OF BARREL (FIG 15), BEING CAREFUL
NOT TO GRASP CYLINDER BY ITS ENDS.

(3) RAISE NOZZLE END OF GUN SO CYLINDER SLIDES DOWN AGAINST THE SPRING
CASE OF THE IGNITION HEAD. (FIG 16) IF NECESSARY, ROTATE CYLINDER SO IT
SLIPS DOWN ALL THE WAY. DO NOT FORCE CYLINDER INTO PLACE AS FORCING MAY
PREMATURELY IGNITE IT.

(4) ROTATE SPRING CASE AND IGNITION CYLINDER CLOCKWISE AS FAR AS THEY
TURN FREELY.

(5) PLACE IGNITION SHIELD OVER CYLINDER. ENGAGE THE SLOT IN THE SHIELD
ON THE SPRING-CASE PIN.

(6) TURN SHIELD, SCREWING IT ONTO IGNITION-HEAD BODY. MAKE SURE THE
THREADS ENGAGE DURING THE FIRST TURN OF THE SHIELD. WHEN THE SLOT ON
THE SHIELD ENGAGES THE LATCH ON THE IGNITION HEAD (FIG 17), THE GUN IS
LOADED.

(7) IF SHIELD CANNOT BE TURNED BY HAND TIGHT ENOUGH TO ENGAGE LATCH,
UNSCREW SHIELD. THEN TURN SHIELD BACKWARDS UNTIL THREADS ENGAGE AND
REPEAT (6) ABOVE.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 14. UNSCREWING IGNITION SHIELD, WITH PRESSURE ON
LATCH.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 15. PLACING IGNITION CYLINDER ON GUN. CARE MUST BE
TAKEN TO AVOID STRIKING OR PUSHING METAL MATCHES OF CYLINDER.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 16. IGNITION CYLINDER IN PLACE ON GUN BEFORE
REPLACEMENT OF IGNITION SHIELD.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 17. IGNITION HEAD ASSEMBLED FOR FIRING OF GUN.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 18. TANK GROUP ADJUSTED ON FIRER.]

19. CARRYING THE TANK GROUP.

THE TANKS ARE SUPPORTED ON THE FIRERS BACK AND SECURED TO IT BY TWO
SHOULDER STRAPS AND TWO PAIRS OF BODY STRAPS. (FIG 18) THE STRAPS MAY
BE ADJUSTED BY THE BUCKLES TO FIT THE OPERATOR. THE SHOULDER STRAPS
PASS OVER THE SHOULDERS AND UNDER THE ARM PITS; THE LOWER BODY STRAPS
ARE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF THE BODY; AND THE UPPER BODY STRAPS ARE
CLASPED ACROSS THE CHEST TO PREVENT THE SHOULDER STRAPS FROM SLIPPING
AND THE TANK GROUP FROM ROLLING OFF THE BACK. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE
VARIOUS STRAPS SHOULD BE MADE UNTIL THE UNIT IS CARRIED WITH THE BOTTOM
OF THE FUEL TANKS AT THE SMALL OF THE OPERATORS BACK. THE TANK GROUP
SHOULD FIT SNUGLY SO THAT IT DOES NOT SHIFT IF THE OPERATOR CHANGES
POSITION QUICKLY.

20. CARRYING THE GUN.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 19. CARRYING THE GUN, WITH HANDS IN POSITION TO
FIRE.]

THE PROCEDURE FOR CARRYING THE GUN IS AS FOLLOWS:

A. CARRY THE GUN WITH THE HOSE AT THE RIGHT SIDE. (FIG 19)

B. GRASP THE VALVE GRIP WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND THE FRONT GRIP WITH
THE LEFT HAND, BEING CAREFUL NOT TO OPERATE THE CONTROLS UNTIL READY TO
FIRE.

C. KEEP THE GUN POINTED AWAY FROM FRIENDLY PERSONNEL AT ALL TIMES.

D. DO NOT FACE THE FRONT OF THE GUN AT ANY TIME. EVEN WHEN NO FUEL
IS BEING EJECTED, THE INCENDIARY CHARGES OF THE IGNITION CYLINDER CAN
CAUSE SEVERE BURNS.

E. KEEP THE GUN DRY AND CLEAN IF POSSIBLE. AVOID GETTING DIRT OR
FOREIGN MATTER INTO THE WEAPON.

F. AVOID ROUGH HANDLING.

G. WEAR GLOVES IF AVAILABLE.

H. CARRY ANY EXTRA IGNITION CYLINDERS ONLY IN METAL CONTAINERS.

21. OPENING PRESSURE-TANK VALVE.

THE RELEASE OF PRESSURE INTO THE FUEL TANK CAUSES A HISSING SOUND.
THEREFORE, OPEN THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE WHILE STILL OUT OF HEARING
RANGE OF THE ENEMY. DO NOT, HOWEVER, OPEN IT PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF PRESSURE LEAKS. TO PREVENT FROTHING OF THE FUEL,
KEEP THE TANK GROUP IN AS NEARLY AN UPRIGHT POSITION AS POSSIBLE WHEN
OPENING PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. BE SURE TO TURN THE VALVE HANDLE ALL THE
WAY IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION. STIFFENING OF THE FUEL HOSE OCCURS
WHEN THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE IS OPENED.

22. RANGES.

FIRERS AND ASSISTANTS SHOULD LEARN TO JUDGE RANGES BY FREQUENT PRACTICE
UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS. THE FIRERS SHOULD BE TRAINED TO APPROACH
AS CLOSE AS PRACTICABLE TO THE TARGET AND TO FIRE IF POSSIBLE AT
POINT-BLANK RANGE FOR THE GREATEST RESULTS.

A. POINT-BLANK RANGE.

(1) EFFECTS. AT VERY CLOSE (POINT-BLANK) RANGE ALMOST ALL OF THE
BURNING FUEL CAN BE FIRED AT GREAT VELOCITY DIRECTLY THROUGH PORTS AND
OPENINGS INTO THE TARGET. MAXIMUM CASUALTIES AND DAMAGE ARE CAUSED IN
THE HOSTILE POSITION.

(2) PROTECTION. COMMON SENSE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT
CASUALTIES TO FRIENDLY PERSONNEL FROM POSSIBLE RICOCHET OR REBOUNDING
OF FLAME. IF THE TARGET INCLUDES A VERTICAL WALL AT A RIGHT ANGLE
TO THE FIRER OR OTHER FRIENDLY PERSONNEL, THE WEAPON SHOULD NOT BE
FIRED AT CLOSER THAN 7 TO 10 YARDS. WHEN THE WEAPON IS FIRED AT SMALL
OPENINGS IN A BUNKER OR PILLBOX, THE FIRER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE
ASSAULT SQUAD SHOULD NOT APPROACH CLOSER THAN 7 TO 10 YARDS FROM THE
TARGET.

B. OTHER EFFECTIVE RANGES.

(1) OPEN FIELDS OF FIRE. WHEN THICKENED GASOLINE IS USED, PORTABLE
FLAME THROWERS MAY FIRE WITH CONSIDERABLE EFFECT AS FAR AS 40 YARDS
UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, DEPENDING ON WIND DIRECTION AND WIND SPEED.
UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS, LIQUID FUEL MAYBE EFFECTIVE AT 20 YARDS.
RESULTS AND ACCURACY ARE NOT AS GREAT AS AT POINT-BLANK RANGE.

(2) JUNGLE OR THICK UNDERBRUSH. IF THE TARGET IS LOCATED IN JUNGLE OR
THICK UNDERBRUSH WITHOUT CLEARED FIELDS OF FIRE, THE EFFECTIVE RANGE OF
THE FLAME THROWER IS REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS ONE HALF, DEPENDING ON THE
NATURE AND DENSITY OF THE VEGETATION.

C. INEFFECTIVE RANGES. ALTHOUGH THE FLAME MAY REACH CONSIDERABLY
FARTHER THAN THE RANGES STATED IN B (1) ABOVE IT MAY BE USELESS
BECAUSE OF THE STEEP ANGLE OF DESCENT AND BECAUSE MUCH OF THE FUEL IS
BURNED BEFORE IT REACHES THE TARGET.

23. WIND DEFLECTION.

WIND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR BECAUSE OF THE LOW VELOCITY OF THE FLAMING
FUEL. WIND CAN LENGTHEN, SHORTEN, OR DEFLECT THE FLAME.

A. HEAD WINDS. HEAD WINDS OF MORE THAN 5 MILES PER HOUR TEND TO CARRY
HEAT OR EVEN FLAME BACK TOWARD THE FIRER. LIQUID FUEL SHOULD NOT BE
FIRED INTO A HEAD WIND OF MORE THAN 5 MILES PER HOUR. THE RANGE AND
ACCURACY OF THICKENED FUELS IS REDUCED.

B. FOLLOWING WINDS OR VERY LIGHT WINDS. BEST RESULTS ARE OBTAINED
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

C. CROSS WINDS. WHEN FIRING AT OR NEAR MAXIMUM RANGE, CROSS WINDS
DEFLECT, BREAKUP, AND DISPERSE THE FLAME. THEY ALSO REDUCE THE RANGE.

24. FIRING POSITIONS.

A. EASE OF AIMING. THE FLAME THROWER CAN BE FIRED FROM ANY POSITION
THAT PERMITS SUFFICIENT FREEDOM TO AIM THE WEAPON, SUBJECT TO THE
CONDITIONS IN B, C, AND D, BELOW. THIS INCLUDES STANDING,
KNEELING, AND PRONE. IN SOME INSTANCES, FLAME THROWERS HAVE BEEN FIRED
WITH TANK GROUPS RESTING ON THE GROUND OR ON SKIDS. IF USED IN THIS
WAY, THE TOPS OF THE FUEL TANKS MUST BE PROPPED UP TO CONFORM TO B,
BELOW.

B. ANGLES OF THE TANKS. WHEN FIRING, THE BOTTOMS OF THE FUEL TANKS
MUST ALWAYS BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE TOPS. THE TOPS OF BOTH
TANKS MUST ALSO EACH BE THE SAME DISTANCE ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL AND
NEITHER TANK SHOULD BE TILTED TO ONE SIDE. OTHERWISE, ONLY A SMALL PART
OF THE FUEL MAY BE BLOWN FROM THE TANKS.

C. RECOIL. STABILITY MUST BE SUFFICIENT TO WITHSTAND THE RECOIL FROM
THE GUN. IF POSSIBLE, THE FIRER SHOULD HOLD THE GUN SNUGLY AGAINST HIS
RIGHT SIDE TO SUPPORT IT AND TO ABSORB ITS RECOIL.

D. PROTECTION. FULL ADVANTAGE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF COVER AND
CONCEALMENT, SUCH AS SHELL CRATERS AND VEGETATION.

25. AIMING.

A. SIGHTING. THERE ARE NO SIGHTS ON THE GUN BECAUSE OF THE SHORT
RANGE FROM WHICH IT IS FIRED, THE VARIETY OF FUELS USED, AND THE MARKED
EFFECTS OF WIND. (PAR 23)

B. FORTIFICATIONS. WHEN FIRING AT A FORTIFIED POSITION, FLAME MUST BE
DIRECTED INTO OPENINGS (GUN PORTS, FIRING SLITS, VENTILATION SCREENS,
DOORWAYS). FLAME INSIDE GIVES THE DESIRED EFFECTS, BUT FLAME ON THE
OUTSIDE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON PERSONNEL WITHIN.

C. THICKENED FUEL. (FIGS 3 AND 20) WHEN FIRING AT OR NEAR MAXIMUM
RANGE, IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL SECONDS FOR A BURST OF THICKENED FUEL TO
CARRY THROUGH THE AIR TO THE TARGET AREA. SHORT BURSTS MAY RESULT IN
MISSES AT LONG RANGE FOR THIS REASON. SKILL IN AIMING IS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT WITH THICKENED FUEL.

D. LIQUID FUEL. WITH LIQUID FUEL, THE GREATEST EFFECT MAY BE OBTAINED
BY PLACING THE FLAME DIRECTLY ON THE TARGET. (FIG 21)

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 20. THICKENED FUEL FLAME HITTING AND CLINGING TO
TARGET. FUEL BURNS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 21. FLAME (LIQUID FUEL) HITTING TARGET.]

26. FIRING.

WITH PRESSURE-TANK VALVE OPEN:

A. PULL TRIGGER. PULL THE TRIGGER RAPIDLY AND VIGOROUSLY. A FLASH
SHOULD APPEAR AT THE FRONT OF THE GUN. THIS SHOWS THAT AN INCENDIARY
CHARGE OF THE IGNITION CYLINDER HAS BEEN IGNITED. RELEASE THE TRIGGER.
(IF THE FLASH DOES NOT APPEAR, PULL THE TRIGGER AGAIN, OR AS OFTEN
AS NECESSARY UP TO FIVE TIMES, UNTIL A FLASH APPEARS.)

B. SQUEEZE FUEL VALVE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PULLING TRIGGER, COMPRESS
THE VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY VIGOROUSLY WITH THE RIGHT HAND. BURNING
FUEL WILL BE PROPELLED FROM THE GUN.

C. ADJUST FIRE. DIRECT THE FLAMING FUEL AT THE TARGET. CONTINUE TO
SQUEEZE THE VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE BURST. WHEN
THICKENED FUEL IS FIRED, FOLLOW THE FUEL WITH EYES TO THE SIDE OF THE
STREAM IN ORDER TO OBSERVE AND CORRECT AIM. (IF EYES ARE DIRECTLY
BEHIND THE STREAM, THE FLAME MAY OBSCURE THE TARGET.)

27. CEASING OR INTERRUPTING FIRE.

TO CEASE OR INTERRUPT FIRING, RELEASE THE CONTROLS.

28. ADDITIONAL BURSTS.

TO FIRE ADDITIONAL BURSTS, REPEAT PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN PARAGRAPHS
26 AND 27, KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE ARE FIVE INCENDIARY CHARGES IN
THE IGNITION CYLINDER AND THAT THE TOTAL FIRING TIME, NOT INCLUDING
TIME BETWEEN BURSTS, IS APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 9 SECONDS. EACH OF THE FIVE
INCENDIARY CHARGES IN THE IGNITION CYLINDER BURNS FOR FROM 8 TO 12
SECONDS.

29. SOAKING THE TARGET.

WHEN LIQUID FUEL IS USED, IT MAY BE DESIRABLE TO SOAK THE TARGET WITH
FUEL FIRST AND IGNITE IT AFTERWARD. TO DO THIS, FIRE ONE OR TWO SHORT
BURSTS WITHOUT PULLING THE TRIGGER. THEN FOLLOW WITH AN IGNITED BURST,
AS IN PARAGRAPH 26.

30. AFTER FIRING.

WHEN THE FIRER HAS RETURNED FROM HIS MISSION, HE SHOULD:

A. REMOVE AND DISCARD THE IGNITION CYLINDER, AS FOLLOWS:

(1) POINT GUN AT THE GROUND.

(2) PRESS LATCH. (FIG 14)

(3) UNSCREW THE IGNITION SHIELD AND ALLOW IGNITION CYLINDER TO FALL
OUT. (BE CAREFUL TO KEEP THE HANDS AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE CYLINDER.)

(4) SAVE THE PARTLY USED CYLINDER FOR TRAINING USE OR DESTROY IT BY
FIRING FROM GUN AFTER FUEL TANKS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED. FOR INFORMATION ON
CARE, HANDLING, AND STORAGE OF CYLINDERS, SEE PARAGRAPH 31.

B. CLOSE THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE BY TURNING VALVE HANDLE CLOCKWISE
(TO CONSERVE REMAINING PRESSURE IN PRESSURE TANK).

C. POINT THE GUN AWAY FROM PERSONNEL AND BLOW OUT THE REMAINING
FUEL, IF ANY, FROM THE FUEL TANKS BY SQUEEZING THE VALVE
LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY UNTIL THERE IS NO FURTHER DISCHARGE. THE
TRIGGER SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING THIS OPERATION.

D. TAKE OFF TANK GROUP FROM THE BACK.

E. INSPECT, CLEAN, AND MAINTAIN THE FLAME THROWER (PARS 55 AND 56)
OR, IF EXPERIENCED MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL IS CLOSE AT HAND, TURN THE
WEAPON OVER TO THEM FOR SERVICING.

F. AFTER SERVICING, PLACE THE WEAPON IN THE PACKING CHEST (PAR 77)
FOR PROTECTED STORAGE, OR PREPARE IT FOR THE NEXT MISSION. (PARS 50
THROUGH 53)

SECTION VIII AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT

31. IGNITION CYLINDER.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIGS 13 AND 22) EITHER THE M1 OR
E1 IGNITION CYLINDER MAY BE USED. IT FITS OVER THE FORE PART OF THE
BARREL ASSEMBLY AND IS REVOLVED BY THE SPRING CASE. (PAR 76) THE FIVE
INCENDIARY CHARGES IN THE CYLINDER ARE SPACED SUFFICIENTLY FAR APART
IN THE PLASTIC BODY TO PREVENT THEIR IGNITING ONE ANOTHER. LEAD-FOIL
SEALS, PLASTIC CLOSURE PLATES, AND WATERPROOF CEMENT MAKE THE UNIT
COMPARATIVELY WATERPROOF.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 22. CUTAWAY VIEW OF IGNITION CYLINDER (M1 OR E1).]

B. ACTION. WHEN THE TRIGGER ROD IS PUSHED FORWARD, ONE OF FIVE METAL
MATCHES TIPPED WITH RED PHOSPHORUS SCRATCHES AN IGNITING MIXTURE. THE
IGNITION CARRIES TO A STARTER MIX AND TO A FEW GRAINS OF BLACK POWDER
ON TOP OF THE INCENDIARY CHARGE. THE BLACK POWDER BLOWS THE FOIL SEAL
AND CLOSURE PLATE CLEAR OF THE FLAME THROWER, AND THE INCENDIARY
CHARGE IGNITES THE FUEL AS IT IS DISCHARGED FROM THE NOZZLE. THE
INCENDIARY CHARGE BURNS FOR FROM 8 TO 12 SECONDS.

C. PACKING. IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE PACKED TWO PER WATERPROOF CAN.
THREE CANS ARE FURNISHED WITH EACH FLAME THROWER. FIFTY CANS (100
IGNITION CYLINDERS) ARE CONTAINED IN EACH PACKING BOX OF EXTRA
CYLINDERS.

D. CARE, HANDLING, AND STORAGE. IGNITION CYLINDERS CONTAIN HAZARDOUS
INCENDIARY MATERIAL AND MUST BE HANDLED WITH DUE CARE. THE FOLLOWING
PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE OBSERVED.

(1) OPENING CANS. DO NOT OPEN CANS CONTAINING CYLINDERS UNTIL READY
TO LOAD FOR A MISSION. (PAR 18) IF AN EXTRA CYLINDER REMAINS IN AN
OPENED CAN, USE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ANY DEFECTIVE CYLINDERS, SUCH
AS THOSE WITH DAMAGED CLOSURE PLATES, SHOULD BE DESTROYED. (PARS 30 AND
46) MOISTURE MAY AFFECT THE CYLINDERS AND ALL POSSIBLE CARE SHOULD BE
TAKEN TO AVOID EXPOSING THEM TO DAMPNESS.

(2) HANDLING CYLINDERS. PRESSURE ON ANY OF THE FIVE METAL MATCHES
(FIG 13) MAY IGNITE AN INCENDIARY CHARGE IN THE CYLINDER. CARE MUST
BE EXERCISED TO AVOID PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE PROJECTING ENDS OF THE
MATCHES EXCEPT WHEN FIRING THE WEAPON. IGNITION CYLINDERS AND CYLINDER
CONTAINERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AGAINST SHOCK. BOXES AND CANS CONTAINING
CYLINDERS MUST NOT BE THROWN OR DROPPED.

(3) STORING CONTAINERS. CONTAINERS OF IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE BEST
STORED IN A DRY, WELL-VENTILATED PLACE, OUT OF THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE
SUN, WELL PROTECTED AGAINST EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES. SMOKING IS NOT
PERMITTED AND MATCHES ARE NOT USED WHERE IGNITION CYLINDERS ARE STORED.

32. CHARGING PRESSURE TANK.

A. GENERAL. THE PRESSURE TANK OF THE FLAME THROWER MUST BE FULLY
CHARGED WITH COMPRESSED AIR OR COMPRESSED NITROGEN BEFORE THE START OF
A MISSION. FOR THE M2-2 FLAME THROWER, A PRESSURE OF AT LEAST 1,700
POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH IS REQUIRED. THIS MAY BE PROVIDED EITHER BY THE
USE OF AN AIR COMPRESSOR CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A PRESSURE OF AT LEAST
1,700 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH, OR BY THE USE OF COMMERCIAL CYLINDERS.
THE FILLING AND CHARGING LINES FROM THE SERVICE KIT ARE USED IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE CYLINDERS. BEFORE AND AFTER CHARGING, FOLLOW THE
PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS 51 AND 55.

B. CHARGING FROM AIR COMPRESSOR. COMPRESSOR, AIR, GASOLINE ENGINE
DRIVEN, 7CFM, M1, IS A SELF-CONTAINED, SKID-MOUNTED MACHINE DESIGNED
FOR USE WITH FLAME THROWERS. IT IS CAPABLE OF CHARGING PRESSURE TANKS
OF FLAME THROWERS AND LARGE 200- OR 220-CUBIC-FOOT COMMERCIAL CYLINDERS
AS WELL. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE FOUND IN THE
MANUAL ACCOMPANYING IT.

C. CHARGING FROM CYLINDERS. IF AN AIR COMPRESSOR IS NOT AVAILABLE,
IT IS NECESSARY TO USE CYLINDERS CONTAINING NITROGEN OR AIR.

(1) VOLUME AND PRESSURE. CYLINDERS COME CHARGED WITH 200 TO 220 CUBIC
FEET OF AIR OR NITROGEN. SINCE CYLINDERS WITH 220 CUBIC FEET OF AIR OR
NITROGEN HAVE A HIGHER INITIAL PRESSURE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THEY
BE PROCURED, IF OBTAINABLE. ALL CYLINDERS USED MUST HAVE A PRESSURE OF
AT LEAST 600 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. ONE OR MORE OF THE CYLINDERS MUST
HAVE A PRESSURE OF AT LEAST 1,800 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. TWO OR MORE
CYLINDERS, PREFERABLY AT LEAST FOUR, SHOULD BE USED, IF AVAILABLE.

(2) CHARGING CAPACITY. FULLY CHARGED CYLINDERS, IF PROPERLY USED IN
ROTATION, HAVE CAPACITY FOR CHARGING PRESSURE TANKS APPROXIMATELY AS
FOLLOWS:

 1 CYLINDER (USED ALONE) 2 PRESSURE TANKS
 2 CYLINDERS (IN COMBINATION) 6 PRESSURE TANKS
 4 CYLINDERS (IN COMBINATION) 24 PRESSURE TANKS
 5 CYLINDERS (IN COMBINATION) 36 PRESSURE TANKS
 6 CYLINDERS (IN COMBINATION) 48 PRESSURE TANKS

(3) APPARATUS. THE APPARATUS FOR CHARGING TWO PRESSURE TANKS BY
THE USE OF CYLINDERS CONSISTS OF A FILLING LINE, TWO CHARGING LINES,
AND TWO CYLINDERS. (FIG 23) THE FILLING LINE AND CHARGING LINES ARE
OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE KIT. (PAR 48) PLUGS ARE PROVIDED TO CLOSE OFF
EITHER HALF OF THE FILLING LINE WHEN ONLY ONE FLAME-THROWER TANK GROUP
IS TO BE CHARGED.

(4) WARNING. OXYGEN IS SOMETIMES SHIPPED IN CYLINDERS HAVING THE SAME
THREADS AS NITROGEN CYLINDERS. IF OXYGEN NOT MIXED WITH NITROGEN, AS IN
AIR, IS INTRODUCED INTO THE FUEL TANKS OF THE PORTABLE FLAME THROWER,
A VIOLENT EXPLOSION MAY RESULT. THEREFORE, THE GREATEST CARE MUST BE
EXERCISED TO SEE THAT ONLY AIR OR NITROGEN IS USED. BEFORE A CYLINDER
IS CONNECTED, IT SHOULD BE TESTED TO DETERMINE THAT IT DOES NOT
CONTAIN STRAIGHT OXYGEN OR SOME COMBUSTIBLE GAS. THIS MAY BE DONE BY
INTRODUCING A BURNING SPLINT INTO A JET OF THE CONTENTS. OXYGEN CAUSES
THE SPLINT TO BURN QUICKLY, WHEREAS NITROGEN EXTINGUISHES THE FLAME. TO
MAKE THE TEST:

(A) FASTEN A THIN SPLINT OF WOOD TO A WIRE AT LEAST A FOOT LONG.

(B) IGNITE THE SPLINT.

(C) STAND ASIDE AND HOLD IT BEFORE THE CYLINDER OUTLET.

(D) CRACK THE VALVE SLIGHTLY TO PERMIT A SMALL STREAM OF GAS TO
EMERGE.

(E) IF THE FLAME FLARES UP, THE GAS IS OXYGEN AND MUST NOT BE USED.

(F) IF THE GAS ITSELF CATCHES FIRE, IT MAY BE HYDROGEN, ACETYLENE, OR
SOME OTHER COMBUSTIBLE GAS, WHICH ALSO MUST NOT BE USED.

(5) ATTACHING LINES TO CYLINDERS. (FIG 23) THE PROCEDURE FOR CHARGING
TWO FLAME THROWER PRESSURE TANKS FROM TWO CYLINDERS OF NITROGEN OR
COMPRESSED AIR BEGINS AS FOLLOWS:

(A) REMOVE THE VALVE-PROTECTION CAPS FROM THE CYLINDERS.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 23. CHARGING TWO PRESSURE TANKS, USING CHARGING AND
FILLING LINES, AND CYLINDERS OF COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN.]

(B) PLACE THE CYLINDERS SIDE BY SIDE WITH BOTH OUTLETS FACING IN THE
SAME DIRECTION. (IF THE GROUND IS NOT LEVEL ENOUGH FOR THE CYLINDERS TO
STAND UP SIDE BY SIDE, LAY THEM HORIZONTALLY WITH BOTH OUTLETS FACE UP.)

(C) BEFORE ATTACHING THE FILLING LINE TO THE CYLINDERS, BLOW OUT
DUST. (PAR 33) THEN CONNECT, USING WRENCHES TO MAKE THE JOINTS PRESSURE
TIGHT. DO NOT KINK OR BEND THE FLEXIBLE HOSE. CYLINDERS MUST BE CLOSE
ENOUGH TOGETHER TO PREVENT STRAIN ON THE FLEXIBLE HOSE.

(D) ATTACH A CHARGING LINE TO EACH OF THE TWO COUPLINGS ON THE
FILLING LINE.

(6) ATTACHING CHARGING LINES TO PRESSURE TANKS.

(A) CLOSE PRESSURE-TANK VALVES.

(B) UNSCREW CAPS FROM CHECK VALVES.

(C) SCREW THE CHARGING-LINE FITTINGS ONTO THE CHECK VALVES.

(D) CLOSE BLEEDERS.

(7) CHARGING. THE OPERATION OF CHARGING TWO PRESSURE TANKS FROM TWO
CYLINDERS IS AS FOLLOWS:

(A) CLOSE BOTH FILLING-LINE VALVES.

(B) OPEN CYLINDER VALVES.

(C) DETERMINE WHICH CYLINDER HAS THE LOWER PRESSURE BY THE GAGES.
OPEN THE FILLING-LINE VALVE AT THE GAGE SHOWING THE LOWER PRESSURE AND
FILL THE PRESSURE TANKS TO THE PRESSURE SHOWN BY THE GAGE. CLOSE THE
VALVE. THEN OPEN THE OTHER FILLING-LINE VALVE AND FILL THE PRESSURE
TANKS UNTIL THEY REACH PRESSURES OF AT LEAST 1,700 POUNDS PER SQUARE
INCH AS SHOWN BY THE GAGE.

(D) WHEN THE PRESSURE TANKS HAVE BEEN FILLED, CLOSE THE FILLING-LINE
VALVES. OPEN THE BLEEDERS ON THE CHARGING LINES AND LEAVE THEM OPEN
UNTIL THE PRESSURE IN THE CHARGING LINES IS RELEASED. THEN CLOSE
BLEEDERS. REMOVE THE CHARGING-LINE FITTINGS FROM THE CHECK VALVES.
SCREW THE THREADED CAPS ON THE CHECK VALVES AND TIGHTEN CAPS WITH A
WRENCH.

(E) REPEAT STEPS IN (A) THROUGH (D) ABOVE FOR AS MANY PAIRS OF
EMPTY FLAME-THROWER TANKS AS REQUIRE CHARGING.

(8) TO INSURE PROPER PRESSURE. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO MAKE CERTAIN
THAT THE COMPRESSION DELIVERED TO THE FLAME-THROWER PRESSURE TANK IS A
FULL 1,700 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.

(A) IF A FILLING-LINE VALVE LEAKS, TIGHTEN THE PACKING NUT ON THE
VALVE WITH A WRENCH.

(B) WHEN THE HIGHER PRESSURE SHOWN ON THE FILLING-LINE GAGES IS LESS
THAN 1,700 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH, CLOSE THE FILLING-LINE VALVE AND THE
CYLINDER VALVE ON THE CYLINDER HAVING THE LOWER PRESSURE. REMOVE AND
REPLACE THIS CYLINDER WITH A FULLY CHARGED CYLINDER. WITH CHALK, MARK
THE PRESSURE ON THE CYLINDER WHICH HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN.

(9) AFTER CHARGING. WHEN CHARGING HAS BEEN COMPLETED:

(A) CLOSE THE FILLING-LINE VALVES. OBSERVE THE PRESSURE INDICATED ON
EACH GAGE AND MARK THE PRESSURE ON EACH CYLINDER USING CRAYON, CHALK,
OR PENCIL.

(B) CLOSE THE VALVES ON THE CYLINDERS.

(C) REMOVE THE CHARGING-LINE FITTINGS FROM THE CHECK VALVES, REPLACE
THE THREADED CAPS ON THE CHECK VALVES, AND TIGHTEN CAPS WITH A WRENCH.

(D) REMOVE THE FILLING LINES FROM THE CYLINDERS. USE TWO WRENCHES AND
TAKE CARE NOT TO TWIST OR KINK THE FLEXIBLE HOSE. SUPPORT THE LINES
DURING THE OPERATION SO THAT THEIR FULL WEIGHT DOES NOT HANG ON THE
FLEXIBLE HOSE DURING REMOVAL.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 24. ARRANGEMENT OF CYLINDERS AND LINES FOR CHARGING
FOUR FLAME THROWERS. FLEXIBLE HOSE (ASSEMBLY E81-3-6) FROM SERVICE KIT
IS USED TO CONNECT TWO FILLING LINES.]

(10) USE OF FOUR-PLACE LINES. (FIG 24) THE FILLING AND CHARGING LINES
FOUND IN TWO OR MORE SERVICE KITS MAY BE COMBINED FOR MORE EFFICIENT
CHARGING OF LARGE NUMBERS OF PRESSURE TANKS. AN ADDITIONAL FLEXIBLE
HOSE IS PROVIDED IN EACH SERVICE KIT FOR CONNECTING TWO FILLING LINES.
THE PROCEDURE FOR CHARGING IS SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR
THE TWO-PLACE LINE. AIR OR NITROGEN IS TAKEN FIRST FROM THE CYLINDER
WITH THE LOWEST PRESSURE AND LAST FROM THE CYLINDER WITH THE HIGHEST
PRESSURE. SEE A (2) ABOVE.

33. PRECAUTIONS WHEN PRESSURE-CHARGING.

PERSONNEL WILL FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS:

A. HANDLING. HANDLE ALL CYLINDERS AND FLAME THROWERS CAREFULLY;
NEVER DROP THEM AND NEVER SUBJECT THEM TO SHOCKS OR BLOWS. KEEP
VALVE-PROTECTION CAPS SECURED WHEN CYLINDERS ARE BEING HANDLED, EXCEPT
WHEN SUCH HANDLING IS INCIDENT TO THE USE OF THE NITROGEN OR AIR.

B. STORAGE. KEEP ALL CYLINDERS AND CHARGED FLAME THROWERS OR TANK
GROUPS (PAR 77) IN OPEN OR CLOSED STORAGE. THEY MUST, HOWEVER, BE
PROTECTED FROM DAMPNESS AND EXCESSIVE RISE IN TEMPERATURE CAUSED BY THE
DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN OR OTHER SOURCE OF HEAT. AVOID STORING THEM NEAR
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES, OR IN PLACES WHERE THEY MAY BE STRUCK BY
MOVING OBJECTS. SEGREGATE EMPTY CYLINDERS TO AVOID CONFUSION.

C. PERSONNEL. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE COMPRESSED GASES UNLESS TRAINED
IN THIS WORK. USE GASES ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY ARE
INTENDED.

D. CYLINDER VALVES. DO NOT TAMPER WITH SAFETY DEVICES IN CYLINDER
VALVES. IF AVAILABLE, USE THE PROPER REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR SAFETY
DEVICES WHICH ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR. IF SUCH PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE,
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE MAKESHIFTS OR NONSTANDARD PARTS.

E. OPENING OF VALVES. OPEN VALVES SLOWLY AND FULLY EACH TIME NITROGEN
OR COMPRESSED AIR IS TRANSFERRED FROM A CYLINDER. WHEN A WRENCH IS
USED, BE SURE IT IS ONE THAT FITS PROPERLY, AND THAT IT IS KEPT READY
FOR INSTANT USE WHILE THE COMPRESSED GAS IS BEING RELEASED.

F. THREADS. SEE THAT THREADS MATCH BEFORE MAKING CONNECTIONS. SOME
VALVES ARE PROVIDED WITH SPECIAL THREADS WHICH MUST BE MATCHED BY THE
THREADS IN THE EQUIPMENT BEING CONNECTED.

G. CORRECT EQUIPMENT. USE GAGES, REGULATORS, HOSE, PIPE, AND TUBING
OF THE TYPE MANUFACTURED OR SPECIFIED FOR THE PARTICULAR APPARATUS OR
COMPRESSED GAS.

H. REPAIR. NEVER ATTEMPT TO ALTER OR REPAIR A CYLINDER.

I. FLAMES AND SPARKS. DO NOT PERMIT FLAMES, SPARKS, OR IGNITION FROM
THE FLAME THROWER OR OTHER SOURCE TO TOUCH HOSE.

J. BLOWING OUT DUST. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE COUPLING AN ATTACHMENT TO THE
PRESSURE TANK OR CYLINDER VALVE, OPEN IT FOR AN INSTANT TO BLOW OUT ANY
DUST OR DIRT. NEVER STAND WHERE GAS OR DIRT MAY BE BLOWN INTO THE EYES
OR FACE. IF THE VALVE IS DIFFICULT TO OPEN, APPLY MORE FORCE GRADUALLY.

K. SPECIAL DEVICES. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE ANY SPECIAL CONNECTIONS OR
EQUIPMENT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF A QUALIFIED EXPERT.

L. KEEPING VALVES CLOSED. KEEP THE VALVE OF EACH CYLINDER CLOSED WHEN
ITS CONTENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY BEING RELEASED FROM OR ADMITTED TO THE
CYLINDER. THIS APPLIES ALIKE TO ALL CYLINDERS, WHETHER THEY CONTAIN A
COMPRESSED GAS OR ARE EMPTY.

34. CHARACTERISTICS OF FUELS.

THICKENED FUELS GIVE UP TO TWICE THE RANGE OF LIQUID FUELS. THE STREAM
OF THICKENED FUEL IS COMPARATIVELY NARROW. MOST OF THE GLUE-LIKE FUEL
CLINGS TO AND BURNS IN OR ON THE TARGET FOR AS LONG AS 6 MINUTES.
LIQUID FUELS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE LARGELY CONSUMED IN FLIGHT TO THE
TARGET. IF THE LOCATION OF SMALL OPENINGS IN THE TARGET IS KNOWN, THE
STREAM OF THICKENED FUEL CAN BE SPOTTED BY ACCURATE AIMING SO THAT
MOST OF THE FUEL ENTERS DIRECTLY INTO THE OPENINGS. WHILE IT DOES NOT
BILLOW AROUND CORNERS AS DOES LIQUID FUEL, THICKENED FUEL STRIKES THE
TARGET WITH FORCE ENOUGH TO RICOCHET INSIDE. IT CLINGS TO SKIN AND
CLOTHING WHILE BURNING. IT ALSO HAS EXCELLENT INCENDIARY EFFECTS. THE
INITIAL FLAME AND SMOKE ARE LESS FROM THICKENED FUEL THAN FROM LIQUID
FUEL, BUT THE LOWER VISIBILITY, GREATER RANGE, AND MUCH LONGER BURNING
PERIOD OF THICKENED FUEL COMPENSATE FOR ITS SMALLER SCREENING EFFECT.
LIQUID FUELS ARE EASIER TO POUR WHEN FILLING THAN ARE THICKENED FUELS.

35. PREPARATION OF THICKENED FUELS.

A. INGREDIENTS. THICKENED FUELS CONSIST OF U.S. ARMY FUEL THICKENER
MIXED WITH FUEL.

(1) THICKENER. U.S. ARMY THICKENER IS SUPPLIED IN AIRTIGHT CANS, EACH
CONTAINING 5-1/4 POUNDS OF THE MATERIAL.

(2) GASOLINE AND FUEL OIL. GASOLINE ALONE IS OFTEN USED WITH
THICKENER, BUT MIXTURES OF GASOLINE AND LIGHT FUEL OIL MAY BE USED
SATISFACTORILY. THE LIGHT FUEL OIL CAN BE EITHER NO. 1 FUEL OIL, NO.
2 FUEL OIL, AUTOMOTIVE DIESEL OIL, OR KEROSENE. THESE MIXTURES GIVE
MORE HEAT AND DO NOT FORM CRUSTS. EXCEPT IN HOT CLIMATES, 75 PERCENT
OR MORE OF THE MIXTURE BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME SHOULD BE GASOLINE. (IF TOO
MUCH LIGHT FUEL OIL IS INCLUDED, THE FUEL TENDS TO SEPARATE INTO TWO
LAYERS.) IN TROPICAL THEATERS, A THICKENED BLEND OF 50 PERCENT GASOLINE
AND 50 PERCENT LIGHT FUEL OIL HAS BEEN REPORTED TO GIVE FAVORABLE
RESULTS. STORAGE QUALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN, HOWEVER. ANOTHER MIXTURE
WHICH HAS BEEN WELL RECOMMENDED IN FIELD REPORTS IS 15 GALLONS OF
GASOLINE TO 5 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL OIL. ISSUE GASOLINE MAY BE USED,
BUT LOCALLY PROCURED GASOLINES WHICH CONTAIN ALCOHOL ARE NOT SUITABLE.

B. PROPORTION OF THICKENER TO FUEL. LESS THICKENER IS RECOMMENDED
THAN FORMERLY. A LOW RATIO OF THICKENER GIVES A THICKENED FUEL WITH
MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIQUID FUEL. ONE CAN OF THICKENER TO 20
U.S. GALLONS OF GASOLINE, OR GASOLINE AND LIGHT FUEL-OIL MIXTURE, GIVES
GOOD RESULTS. THIS IS A 4.2 PERCENT BY WEIGHT MIXTURE. EXCEPT IN HOT
WEATHER, A FUEL MIXTURE OF LESS THAN 3 PERCENT THICKENER REQUIRES SUCH
LONG STIRRING THAT ITS PREPARATION IS IMPRACTICAL.

C. EQUIPMENT. AN OPEN-HEAD 55-GALLON OR 42-GALLON DRUM AND AN
IMPROVISED WOODEN MIXING PADDLE ARE USED. FIVE-GALLON CANS MAY
BE EMPLOYED TO TRANSFER THE INGREDIENTS. THE PADDLE SHOULD BE
APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET LONG, 2 INCHES WIDE, AND 1 INCH THICK. IF A
STANDARD 55-GALLON, OPEN-HEAD DRUM WITH AN INTERNAL DIAMETER OF 27-7/16
INCHES IS USED, THE IMPROVISED PADDLE SHOULD BE MARKED TO INDICATE
GALLONS AS FOLLOWS:

 GALLONS INCHES
 40 23-1/2
 20 11-3/4

DO NOT USE A METAL PADDLE BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF STRIKING A SPARK
FROM THE DRUM. NEVER USE GALVANIZED CONTAINERS FOR MIXING AND STORING
THICKENED FUELS. THESE MAY CAUSE THE FUEL TO BREAK DOWN AND BECOME
EXCESSIVELY THIN. AN IMPROVISED FUNNEL MAY BE HELPFUL IN FILLING DRUMS
WITH PREPARED FUEL FOR AGING OR TRANSPORTING.

D. TEMPERATURES.

(1) BELOW 50 DEGREES. IF THE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW 50 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT, IT IS HELPFUL TO PREPARE THICKENED FUEL INDOORS, IN A
HEATED ROOM. ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY OBSERVED. (PAR 40)

(2) ABOVE 90 DEGREES. WHEN THE FUEL IS HOTTER THAN 90 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT, THE THICKENER REACTS VERY RAPIDLY. IN THIS CASE, IT IS
EASIER TO PREPARE BATCHES OF 20 GALLONS EACH, BUT ANY NUMBER OF BATCHES
MAY BE PREPARED IN SUCCESSION.

E. MOISTURE.

(1) EFFECT OF MOISTURE. WATER IN THICKENED FUEL BREAKS DOWN OR
REDUCES THE VISCOSITY OF THE GEL AND THEREBY REDUCES THE RANGE OF THE
FLAME THROWER. THIS EFFECT MAY NOT BE NOTICEABLE AT ONCE, BUT THE
STABILITY OF THE FUEL IS AFFECTED.

(2) DRYNESS OF THICKENER. DRY THICKENER IS EXTREMELY HYGROSCOPIC,
THAT IS, IT ABSORBS MOISTURE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE VERY RAPIDLY. FOR THIS
REASON, THICKENER IS SHIPPED IN HERMETICALLY SEALED TIN CANS CONTAINING
THE EXACT QUANTITY OF POWDER REQUIRED FOR MIXING WITH 20 GALLONS
OF FUEL TO PREPARE A 4.2 PERCENT MIXTURE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE
GASOLINE OR FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE BE MEASURED OUT BEFORE THE THICKENER
CONTAINER IS OPENED. THE POWDER THEN SHOULD BE POURED IMMEDIATELY INTO
THE LIQUID.

(3) DRYNESS OF CONTAINERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CONTAINERS USED
IN MIXING AND HANDLING THE FUEL BE DRY.

(4) KEEPING WATER OUT OF GASOLINE. GASOLINE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAS
BEEN STORED IN VENTED CONTAINERS, FREQUENTLY INCLUDES FREE WATER.
THEREFORE, WHEN USING GASOLINE FROM A BULK-STORAGE TANK OR AN OPEN
DRUM, FIRST PLACE IT IN A CLEAN, DRY DRUM; ALLOW IT TO STAND QUIETLY
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR; THEN CAREFULLY POUR OFF THE GASOLINE FROM THE TOP
AND DISCARD THE LAST GALLON OR TWO.

F. POURING AND STIRRING. (FIG 25) THE LIQUID FUEL IS POURED INTO THE
OPEN DRUM; A PAIL OR A PADDLE (PAR 35 C) IS USED FOR MEASURING. ONE
MAN THEN STIRS THE FUEL VIGOROUSLY. ANOTHER TAKES A CAN OF THICKENER,
SPLITS IT WITH A MACHETE, BAYONET, OR AX, AND POURS IT IMMEDIATELY
INTO THE FUEL. ANY LARGE LUMPS OF POWDER ARE BROKEN BY HAND BEFORE THE
POWDER IS ADDED TO THE FUEL. WHEN MIXING 40 GALLONS AT A TIME, THE
TWO CANS OF THICKENER SHOULD BE OPENED AND ADDED TO THE FUEL IN RAPID
SUCCESSION. IF THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST CAN ARE PERMITTED TO GEL
BEFORE ADDING THE SECOND CAN, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A UNIFORM
MIX. CONTINUE TO STIR.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 25. MEASURING FUEL INGREDIENT INTO MIXING DRUM.
PADDLE FOR MEASURING AND STIRRING IS IMPROVISED.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 26. TRANSFERRING NEWLY MIXED THICKENED FUEL FROM
MIXING DRUM TO STORAGE OR SHIPPING CONTAINER FOR AGING.]

G. EXAMINING FUEL. LIFT THE PADDLE QUICKLY. IF THE MIXTURE DROPS
OR RUNS FROM THE PADDLE, ADDITIONAL STIRRING IS NECESSARY. WHEN THE
PADDLE COMES OUT CLEAN, EXCEPT FOR AN ADHERING FILM, STIRRING SHOULD BE
STOPPED, PROVIDED THERE IS NO FURTHER VISIBLE

SETTLING OF PARTICLES OF THICKENER.

H. LOADING SHIPPING DRUMS. WHEN STIRRING IS COMPLETED, THE MIX IS
IMMEDIATELY BUCKETED (FIG 26) THROUGH A FUNNEL INTO THE SHIPPING DRUM.
THE SECOND BUNG HOLE SHOULD BE OPEN, IF POSSIBLE, TO PROVIDE A VENT
TO AID IN POURING. TWO MEN DO THE BUCKETING, EACH HANDLING ONE PAIL
SO THAT THE FUNNEL MAY BE KEPT LOADED WITH MIX AND THE SHIPPING DRUM
FILLED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. FINALLY, THE OPEN-END DRUM SHOULD BE
PICKED UP AND ITS CONTENTS POURED INTO THE FUNNEL. NOT MORE THAN 50
GALLONS OF THICKENED FUEL SHOULD BE LOADED INTO A 55-GALLON DRUM. THE
FUNNEL SHOULD THEN BE REMOVED AND REPLACED BY A PLUG. THE VENT OPENING
OF THE DRUM SHOULD ALSO BE CLOSED. (SEE PARAGRAPH 39 FOR PRESSURE
METHOD OF FILLING STORAGE DRUMS.)

I. UNUSED THICKENER. ANY THICKENER REMAINING IN OPENED CANS SHOULD BE
DISCARDED. SINCE MOISTURE IN THE AIR CAN QUICKLY RUIN ITS PROPERTIES,
NO ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO SAVE IT.

J. AGING AND STORING. NEWLY MIXED FUEL HAS THE APPEARANCE OF TAPIOCA
PUDDING. (FIG 27) IT SHOULD PREFERABLY BE STORED OVERNIGHT BEFORE
USE. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE FIRED WITHIN 1 HOUR AFTER MIXING. TO KEEP
FUEL IN GOOD CONDITION, DRUMS FOR SHIPPING AND STORING MUST BE CLEAN,
MOISTUREPROOF, DRY, STRONG, AND UNRUSTED, BUT NOT GALVANIZED. THEY MUST
BE KEPT TIGHTLY CLOSED AND SHOULD BE LAID ON THEIR SIDES SO THAT RAIN
WATER WILL NOT COLLECT AROUND THE BUNGS.

K. TESTING FUEL. BEFORE USE ON MISSIONS, ALL FUELS SHOULD BE TESTED
BY BEING FIRED FROM A FLAME THROWER. THIS IS ADVISABLE BECAUSE THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUEL INGREDIENTS OFTEN VARY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 27. CONTRASTING NEWLY MIXED THICKENED FUEL (RIGHT)
WITH AGED FUEL (LEFT).]

36. PREPARATION OF LIQUID FUELS.

A. CHOICE OF INGREDIENTS. THIN FUELS ARE EASY TO IGNITE, BUT THEY
LACK RANGE AND ARE LARGELY BURNED IN FLIGHT BEFORE REACHING THE TARGET.
FOR THIS REASON, LIQUID FUELS SHOULD CONTAIN THE LOWEST PROPORTION
OF GASOLINE AND THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF HEAVIER OILS THAT PERMITS
EASY IGNITION. IN HOT CLIMATES, LESS GASOLINE IS NEEDED THAN IN COLD
CLIMATES. EXACTNESS OF PROPORTION, HOWEVER, IS NOT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.
SUITABLE BLENDS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

(1) EQUAL PARTS BY WEIGHT OR BY VOLUME OF GASOLINE, LIGHT FUEL OIL, AND
HEAVY (BUNKER) FUEL OIL. THE LIGHT FUEL OIL CAN BE EITHER NO. 1 FUEL
OIL, NO. 2 FUEL OIL, AUTOMOTIVE DIESEL OIL, OR KEROSENE.

(2) ONE PART GASOLINE TO FOUR PARTS OF CLEANED CRANKCASE DRAININGS.
(PAR 36E) UNUSED MOTOR LUBRICATING OIL CAN BE EMPLOYED IN PLACE
OF CRANKCASE DRAININGS, BUT USUALLY IT WILL BE UNAVAILABLE FOR
FLAME-THROWER USE.

B. PREPARATION OF INGREDIENTS. BEFORE MIXING BLENDS, THE FOLLOWING
STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN:

(1) GASOLINE, DIESEL OILS, AND FUEL OILS. THESE FUEL MATERIALS SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO STAND QUIETLY FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES TO PERMIT ANY SMALL
QUANTITY OF WATER PRESENT TO SETTLE TO THE BOTTOM. WHEN TRANSFERRING
THE FUEL TO ANOTHER CONTAINER, REMOVE THE FUEL CAREFULLY SO THAT NO
WATER IS REMIXED WITH IT.

(2) CRANKCASE DRAININGS. IF POSSIBLE, CRANKCASE DRAININGS SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO STAND QUIETLY IN A CONTAINER FOR AT LEAST 1 DAY. WHEN
POURING, TAKE CARE TO PREVENT THE TRANSFER OF ANY OF THE SLUDGE WHICH
MAY HAVE SETTLED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER.

C. EQUIPMENT. AN OPEN-HEAD 55-GALLON OR 42-GALLON DRUM AND AN
IMPROVISED WOODEN MIXING PADDLE ARE USED. THE PADDLE SHOULD BE
APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET LONG, 2 INCHES WIDE, AND 1 INCH THICK. A METAL
PADDLE SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF STRIKING A SPARK
FROM THE DRUM. FIVE-GALLON CANS MAY ALSO BE FURNISHED FOR MEASURING AND
TRANSFERRING INGREDIENTS. CLEAN, UNRUSTED, STEEL STORAGE DRUMS SHOULD
BE AT HAND. THEY SHOULD BE AT LEAST 16-GAGE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT STRENGTH
TO WITHSTAND THE INTERNAL VAPOR PRESSURE OF THE FUEL.

D. STIRRING. ALL THE INGREDIENTS SHOULD BE STIRRED IN THE DRUM WITH
THE PADDLE UNTIL THEY APPEAR TO FORM A UNIFORM MIXTURE. THIS SHOULD
REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES.

E. CRANKCASE-DRAINING BLENDS. IF CRANKCASE DRAININGS ARE USED AS
AN INGREDIENT (PAR 36B), IT IS PREFERABLE TO ALLOW THE PREPARED
MIXTURE TO SETTLE FOR 24 HOURS AFTER STIRRING, BECAUSE THE GASOLINE IN
THE MIXTURE MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL SLUDGE TO BE DEPOSITED. EVEN AFTER
THIS SETTLING PERIOD, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE MIXTURE BE POURED
THROUGH CHEESECLOTH OR SOME SIMILAR FABRIC BEFORE THE FLAME THROWER
IS FILLED. CRANKCASE-DRAINING BLENDS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE
FLAME THROWER ONLY LONG ENOUGH FOR COMPLETION OF A MISSION, BECAUSE
ADDITIONAL SLUDGE WHICH MAY FORM FROM STANDING WILL CLOG THE WEAPON.

F. TRANSFERRING. THE MIXTURE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED EITHER DIRECTLY
INTO THE FLAME-THROWER FUEL TANKS (PARS 37 THROUGH 40) OR INTO STORAGE
DRUMS. (PAR 35H)

G. EMERGENCY MIXING IN FUEL TANKS. IN AN EMERGENCY, MIXING CAN BE
DONE IN THE FLAME-THROWER FUEL TANKS BY ADDING THE INGREDIENTS IN
CORRECT PROPORTIONS AND THEN SHAKING OR STIRRING.

H. TESTING FUEL. BEFORE FUEL IS USED ON A MISSION, IT SHOULD BE
TESTED, IF POSSIBLE, BY BEING FIRED FROM A FLAME THROWER.

I. STORAGE. FUELS MAY BE USED IMMEDIATELY AFTER PREPARATION. IF
THE BLEND CONTAINS CRANKCASE OILS, THE FUEL SHOULD BE FIRED AS SOON
AS PRACTICABLE AFTER FILLING. OTHER LIQUID BLENDS MAY BE STORED
INDEFINITELY UNTIL REQUIRED FOR USE. FOR STORAGE PRECAUTIONS SEE
PARAGRAPH 40. THE STORAGE DRUMS ALSO SHOULD BE KEPT TIGHTLY CLOSED TO
PREVENT LOSS OF GASOLINE THROUGH EVAPORATION AND TO PREVENT MOISTURE
FROM ENTERING THE FUEL. IF STORED IN THE OPEN, THE DRUMS SHOULD BE LAID
ON THEIR SIDES SO THAT RAIN WATER WILL NOT COLLECT ADJACENT TO THE
BUNGS. AN UNRUSTED AND UNDAMAGED 16-GAGE OR 18-GAGE DRUM HAS SUFFICIENT
STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE INTERNAL VAPOR PRESSURE OF THE FUEL.

37. FILLING BY POURING.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 28. FILLING FUEL TANKS BY POURING. ANY CLEAN
CONTAINER MAY BE USED. A FUNNEL MAY BE IMPROVISED.]

(FIG 28) THIS METHOD IS THE SIMPLEST AND QUICKEST FOR LIQUID FUEL,
BUT IT MAY BE TOO SLOW FOR SOME THICKENED FUELS. THE PROCEDURE IS AS
FOLLOWS:

A. STAND THE TANK GROUP ON THE GROUND OR A PLATFORM. IF THE TANK
GROUP IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE GUN GROUP, LOCK COUPLING PLUG IN TANK
COUPLING. (PAR 70)

B. USING A 1-3/4-INCH WRENCH, UNSCREW THE FILLING PLUG AND THE
SAFETY-HEAD PLUG.

C. INSPECT INTERIOR OF TANKS TO SEE IF CLEAN AND FREE FROM FOREIGN
MATTER. IF NOT CLEAN, FLUSH WITH GASOLINE.

D. USING AN IMPROVISED FUNNEL, FILL TO WITHIN 2 INCHES OF THE TOP OF
BOTH PLUG OPENINGS. THIS ALLOWS SUFFICIENT VOID. THE TANKS WILL THEN
CONTAIN APPROXIMATELY 4 GALLONS OF FUEL.

E. WIPE THE FUEL-TANK PLUG SEATS AND THE PLUG THREADS WITH A CLEAN,
DRY CLOTH. (FIG 29) IF PLUG HAS A TENDENCY TO FREEZE TO SEAT, LUBRICATE
(PAR 49 B) BEFORE SCREWING IN THE FILLING AND SAFETY-HEAD PLUG
ASSEMBLIES. TIGHTEN WITH WRENCH.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 29. WIPING PLUG SEAT.]

F. WIPE ANY SPILLED FUEL FROM WEAPON.

38. FILLING BY FORCE PUMP.

A FORCE PUMP, IF AVAILABLE, MAY BE INSTALLED WITH A SHORT LENGTH OF
PIPE IN THE TOP OPENING OF A DRUM OF FUEL FOR FILLING FLAME-THROWER
FUEL TANKS. KEEP WORKING PARTS OF PUMP CLEAN.

39. FILLING BY BLOWING.

THICKENED FUEL MAY BE READILY FORCED INTO THE FUEL TANKS OF FLAME
THROWERS BY THE USE OF EXTREMELY LOW PRESSURES OF COMPRESSED AIR OR
NITROGEN. FLAME THROWER FUEL FILLING KIT E6 OR EQUIVALENT MAY BE USED.
WHEN EQUIPMENT IS AVAILABLE, FILLING BY BLOWING IS MORE EFFICIENT FOR
FILLING LARGE NUMBERS OF FLAME THROWERS WITH THICKENED FUEL. POURING
OR PUMPING ARE MORE TIME-CONSUMING, DEPENDING ON THE CONSISTENCY OF
THE GEL. THE CONSISTENCY MAY VARY AMONG BATCHES EVEN WHEN THE SAME
PROPORTION OF THICKENER IS USED. THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE FUEL
SEEMS TO CAUSE THIS VARIATION. THE PRECAUTIONS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 40
SHOULD BE OBSERVED.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 30. BLOWING THICKENED FUEL INTO FUEL TANKS BY USE OF
CYLINDERS OF COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN.]

A. SOURCE OF PRESSURE. WHEN THE PRESSURE IN CYLINDERS OF COMPRESSED
AIR OR NITROGEN HAS FALLEN TOO LOW TO BE OF FURTHER USE IN FILLING
PRESSURE TANKS OF FLAME THROWERS, THE REMAINING PRESSURE MAY BE USED
TO BLOW FUEL INTO FUEL TANKS IF THE REGULATOR VALVE CAN REDUCE PRESSURE
DOWN TO 20 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. FOR PRECAUTIONS, SEE PARAGRAPH 33.
AN AIR COMPRESSOR OR A HAND AIR PUMP (TIRE PUMP) MAY BE USED IN PLACE
OF A CYLINDER IF THE LATTER IS NOT AVAILABLE. PRESSURE OF NO MORE THAN
15 TO 20 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH SHOULD BE USED ON THE FUEL DRUMS. ONLY
A DIAPHRAGM-TYPE REGULATOR VALVE CAN BE USED SAFELY. THIS VALVE MUST BE
CAPABLE OF REGULATING ANY PRESSURE THAT MAY BE APPLIED TO IT.

B. DRUMS. CLEAN, NONCORRODED, STEEL, 55-GALLON DRUMS SHOULD BE USED.
DRUMS OF UNITED STATES MANUFACTURE WHICH MEET REQUIREMENTS WILL BE
STAMPED ICC-5 OR ICC-5A, FOLLOWED BY THREE NUMBERS IN SEQUENCE, FOR
EXAMPLE, 14-55-44. THE NUMBER 14 INDICATES THE GAGE OF THE METAL;
55 INDICATES THE CAPACITY IN GALLONS; AND 44 INDICATES THE YEAR
OF MANUFACTURE. A STEEL DRUM OF 14 GAGE, OR HEAVIER, IS PREFERABLE,
BUT LIGHTER DRUMS (OF 16 OR 18 GAGE) MAY BE USED. DRUMS MADE OF GAGES
LIGHTER THAN 18 GAGE (20-OR 22-GAGE) MUST NOT BE USED. DRUMS SHOULD
NEVER BE MOVED WHILE UNDER PRESSURE.

C. CONNECTIONS. THE SOURCE OF PRESSURE (SEE A ABOVE), THE DRUM
OF FUEL, THE FUEL-FILLING LINE, THE AIR HOSE, AND OTHER PARTS, ARE
CONNECTED AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 30. THREADED ADAPTERS ARE USED, AS
NECESSARY, TO FIT LINES TO THE DRUM. ALL THREADED CONNECTIONS SHOULD
BE MADE TIGHT BY THE USE OF WRENCHES ON THE JOINTS. THE DRUM AND THE
PRESSURE CYLINDER (IF THE LATTER IS USED) SHOULD BE LAID ON THEIR SIDES
ON THE GROUND OR A PLATFORM. THE OPENING OF THE DRUM CONNECTED TO THE
FUEL-FILLING HOSE SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE GROUND OR PLATFORM. IF TANK
GROUP IS FILLED WITHOUT GUN GROUP, LOCK COUPLING PLUG (PAR 70) IN TANK
COUPLING.

D. PROCEDURE. TO FILL FUEL TANKS:

(1) REMOVE BOTH THE FILLING AND SAFETY-HEAD PLUGS.

(2) INSPECT INTERIOR OF TANKS TO SEE IF CLEAN AND FREE FROM FOREIGN
MATTER. IF NOT CLEAN, FLUSH WITH GASOLINE.

(3) PLACE END OF FUEL-FILLING HOSE IN EITHER ONE OF THE TWO FUEL-TANK
PLUG HOLES, USING A NIPPLE AS A SPOUT.

(4) START AIR COMPRESSOR OR PUMP, OR OPEN THE VALVE ON THE CYLINDER OF
COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN. OPEN REGULATOR VALVE ON FILLING LINE BY
TURNING HANDLE SLOWLY UNTIL GAGE SHOWS 15 TO 20 POUNDS PRESSURE, BUT
NO MORE. CAUTION: CRACKING, OR OPENING A CYLINDER VALVE WITHOUT
USING THE PROPER REGULATOR VALVE (PAR 39 A), MAY RESULT IN EXPLOSIVE
PRESSURE IN THE DRUMS.

(5) BOTH TANKS MUST BE FILLED TO WITHIN 2 INCHES OF THEIR TOPS. CLOSE
VALVE ON FUEL-FILLING HOSE TO HALT FLOW AT THIS LEVEL.

(6) IF NO ADDITIONAL FLAME THROWERS ARE TO BE FILLED, CLOSE
PRESSURE-CYLINDER VALVE, OR STOP COMPRESSOR OR PUMP. THEN, USING
WRENCH, SLIGHTLY LOOSEN THE AIR LINE AT THE DRUM, ALLOWING PRESSURE
TO BLEED. WHEN THE PRESSURE IN THE DRUM HAS FALLEN TO THAT OF THE
ATMOSPHERE, CLOSE REGULATOR VALVE.

(7) ROLL DRUM SLIGHTLY AND GENTLY UNTIL FUEL-FILLING HOSE IS AT TOP OF
DRUM.

(8) IF THERE ARE VALVES ON EACH END OF THE FUEL-FILLING HOSE, USE
WRENCH TO SLIGHTLY LOOSEN HOSE, ALLOWING GRADUAL ESCAPE OF PRESSURE.
STAND AWAY FROM, AND AT THE SIDE OF, THE CONNECTION. KEEP HOSE POINTED
AWAY FROM OTHER PERSONNEL. WHEN ALL PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELEASED,
COMPLETE UNSCREWING OF HOSE.

(9) WIPE FUEL-TANK PLUG SEATS AND THE PLUG THREADS WITH A CLEAN, DRY
CLOTH. THEN SCREW IN FILLING PLUG AND SAFETY-HEAD PLUG ASSEMBLIES,
APPLYING GREASE (PAR 49 B) IF PLUG TENDS TO FREEZE TO SEAT. TIGHTEN
WITH WRENCH. WIPE ANY SPILLED FUEL FROM WEAPON.

40. PRECAUTIONS WITH FUELS.

A. FLAMMABILITY. ALL FUELS USED IN FLAME THROWERS OBVIOUSLY ARE
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE AND MUST BE HANDLED, STORED, AND USED WITH EXTREME
CARE. DIESEL OIL, FUEL OIL, AND KEROSENE REQUIRE THE SAME CARE AS DOES
GASOLINE.

B. INDOOR STORAGE. WHEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO HANDLE GASOLINE IN
A ROOM OR BUILDING, THE WINDOWS AND DOORS SHOULD BE OPEN AND CARE
TAKEN THAT NO UNPROTECTED FLAME WHICH MIGHT IGNITE THE FUMES IS IN THE
VICINITY. THE DOORS AND WINDOWS SHOULD REMAIN OPEN FOR A SUFFICIENT
LENGTH OF TIME AFTERWARD TO ALLOW ANY VAPORIZED GASOLINE TO ESCAPE.

C. FLAMES AND SPARKS. THE PRESENCE OF OPEN FLAMES, HEATED STOVES,
ELECTRICAL TOOLS AND APPARATUS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT LIKELY TO CAUSE
SPARKS MUST NOT BE PERMITTED. EVEN NAILS AND METAL CLEATS IN SHOES ARE
A POTENTIAL HAZARD IN THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE FUMES.

D. SMOKING. NO SMOKING SIGNS MUST BE POSTED IN PROMINENT PLACES
ABOUT THE PREMISES AND THE RULE AGAINST SMOKING MUST BE STRICTLY
ENFORCED.

E. VENTILATION AND CLEANING. THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH FUEL IS STORED
OR USED MUST BE WELL VENTILATED AND THOROUGHLY CLEANED EVERY DAY. NO
RUBBISH OR OTHER FLAMMABLE MATERIAL SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN OR
NEAR SUCH BUILDINGS.

F. SPILLAGE. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT FUEL IS NOT SPILLED. ANY
SPILLAGE SHOULD BE REMOVED PROMPTLY.

G. SAFETY CANS. SAFETY CANS SHOULD BE USED, IF POSSIBLE, FOR STORING
SMALL QUANTITIES OF GASOLINE, AS THEY HAVE COVERS THAT MUST BE FORCIBLY
HELD OPEN TO REMOVE OR ADD GASOLINE.

H. RAGS. METAL RECEPTACLES WITH METAL LIDS SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR
DISCARDED, OILY, OR GASOLINE-SOAKED RAGS. THESE RAGS MUST BE DISPOSED
OF DAILY.

I. ELECTRICAL APPARATUS. VAPORPROOF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS,
SWITCHES, AND OTHER APPLIANCES OF APPROVED TYPE SHOULD BE USED. OPEN
SWITCHES, RELAYS, AND SIMILAR APPARATUS, OR MOTORS WITH COMMUTATORS,
MUST NOT BE USED WHERE GASOLINE FUMES MAY BE ENCOUNTERED.

J. HOSE. FLEXIBLE METAL, RUBBER, AND RUBBER-METAL HOSE SHOULD BE
INSPECTED REGULARLY (AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A YEAR) AND DISCARDED WHEN
NOTICEABLY DETERIORATED.

K. TOXIC FUMES. GASOLINE FUMES ARE SOMEWHAT TOXIC AND SHOULD NOT BE
INHALED.

L. LEAKS. LEAKS MUST NEVER BE NEGLECTED, AND THE FACT THAT GASOLINE
IS A DANGEROUS LIQUID MUST ALWAYS BE KEPT IN MIND. INSPECTIONS FOR
LEAKS SHOULD BE MADE FREQUENTLY, PARTICULARLY AT PIPE AND HOSE JOINTS.

M. FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. CARBON TETRACHLORIDE, CARBON DIOXIDE, OR
FOAM-TYPE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS SHOULD BE PROVIDED AND LOCATED WHERE THEY
WILL BE ACCESSIBLE IN THE EVENT OF FIRE. SAND, NOT WATER, SHOULD BE
THROWN ON BURNING FUEL IF SUITABLE EXTINGUISHERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

N. LEADED GASOLINE. GASOLINE OFTEN CONTAINS A POISONOUS LEAD
COMPOUND. SUCH GASOLINE, OR FUEL CONTAINING LEADED GASOLINE, SHOULD NOT
BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE BODY, ESPECIALLY THE LIPS, EYES, OPEN CUTS, AND
SORES.

SECTION IX OPERATION UNDER UNUSUAL CONDITIONS

41. WET CONDITIONS.

THE M2-2 FLAME THROWER MAY BE CARRIED AND FIRED SUCCESSFULLY IN THE
RAIN OR EVEN AFTER SHORT IMMERSION IN WATER. AFTER USE WHEN WET, IT
SHOULD BE DRIED TO PREVENT RUSTING, CLEANED, AND LUBRICATED. (PARS 49
AND 55) AREAS WHERE PAINT HAS WORN OFF SHOULD BE TOUCHED UP WITH FRESH
PAINT. THE WEAPON SHOULD BE STORED IN A DRY PLACE. MOISTURE MUST NOT BE
ALLOWED TO ENTER FUEL, INGREDIENTS OF FUEL, OR CONTAINERS OF IGNITION
CYLINDERS.

42. DUST AND MUD.

KEEP ALL POSSIBLE DUST, EARTH, AND MUD OUT OF THE FLAME THROWER;
PARTICLES MAY INTERFERE WITH THE OPERATION OF SPRING CASE, VALVES,
BEARINGS, AND PRESSURE REGULATOR. STORE WEAPONS AND AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT
IN CLOSED CHESTS AND BOXES WHEN NOT IN USE. (PAR 77) CLEAN BEFORE USE.
(PARS 51 AND 52)

43. HEAT.

A HOT CLIMATE OR EXPOSURE TO THE SUN MAKES THE FUEL THINNER WHEN IN
CONTAINERS. THIN FUEL HAS SHORTER RANGE; IT IS LARGELY CONSUMED IN THE
AIR BEFORE IT REACHES USUAL EFFECTIVE RANGES. WHERE THE CLIMATE IS
TORRID, LESS GASOLINE OR OTHER THINNING AGENTS SHOULD BE USED IN A FUEL
BLEND THAN NORMALLY. (PARS 34 THROUGH 36)

44. COLD.

COLD WEATHER REDUCES TOTAL HEAT PRODUCED AT TARGET BUT SELDOM ENOUGH
TO SERIOUSLY LOWER VALUE OF A FIRING MISSION. INCENDIARY EFFECTS MAY
BE DECREASED BECAUSE MATERIEL IS LESS FLAMMABLE WHEN COLD. THE WEAPON
MAY BE USED AT TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS MINUS 20 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. TO
IMPROVE IGNITION, USE MORE GASOLINE IN FUEL THAN NORMALLY. (PARS 34
THROUGH 36)

45. WIND.

FLAME THROWERS SHOULD NOT BE FIRED INTO STRONG HEAD WINDS OR ACROSS
STRONG SIDE WINDS. (PAR 23)

SECTION X DEMOLITION TO PREVENT ENEMY USE

46. DESTRUCTION PROCEDURE.

IF CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD FORCE ABANDONMENT OF CHEMICAL WARFARE MATERIEL
IN THE FIELD, IT IS DESTROYED OR RENDERED USELESS TO PREVENT ITS USE OR
STUDY BY THE ENEMY. THE FOLLOWING METHODS ARE RECOMMENDED:

A. FLAME THROWER. ONE OR MORE SMALL-ARMS BULLETS THROUGH THE FUEL
TANKS WILL PREVENT ANY IMMEDIATE USE OF THE FLAME THROWER. ADDITIONAL
ROUNDS MAY BE PUT THROUGH THE PRESSURE TANK. IF THE PRESSURE TANK IS
CHARGED, THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE SHOULD BE OPENED FOR A FEW SECONDS,
THUS PERMITTING THE CONTENTS TO DISSIPATE. THIS IS NECESSARY IF ROUNDS
ARE TO BE FIRED POINT-BLANK. THE GUN MAY BE RENDERED USELESS BY BENDING
IT OVER A HARD OBJECT. A SLEDGE OR AX WILL DEMOLISH VALVES AND TUBES. A
FRAGMENTATION GRENADE WILL ALSO ACHIEVE DEMOLITION.

B. FILLING AND CHARGING APPARATUS. THE FLEXIBLE TUBING, GAGES, AND
VALVES MAY BE DESTROYED BY BLOWS WITH AN AX, SLEDGE, OR OTHER HEAVY
INSTRUMENT. THE LARGE PRESSURE CYLINDERS ARE RENDERED USELESS BY
RELEASING THE CONTENTS AND THEN DESTROYING THE VALVES BY BLOWS WITH AN
AX OR SLEDGE. CYLINDERS CAN BE STACKED LIKE CORDWOOD IN GROUPS OF FIVE
AND DEMOLISHED BY THE DETONATION OF FOUR 1/2-POUND BLOCKS (2 POUNDS) OF
TNT IN THEIR MIDST. THE AIR COMPRESSOR MAY BE DESTROYED BY A SIMILAR
PROCEDURE.

C. FUEL. BURN.

D. MIXING APPARATUS. CONTAINERS AND FILLING LINES MAY BE RENDERED
USELESS BY AX OR SLEDGE BLOWS, OR BY SMALL-ARMS FIRE.

E. THICKENER. CANS OF THICKENER SHOULD BE BROKEN OPEN. CONTENTS
SHOULD BE THROWN INTO A FIRE OR INTO A BODY OF WATER.

F. IGNITION CYLINDERS. BURN TO DESTROY. PERSONNEL SHOULD STAY
SEVERAL YARDS FROM THE FIRE BECAUSE THE CYLINDERS IGNITE WITH A SLIGHT
DETONATION.

SECTION XIII LUBRICATION

49. LUBRICATION.

A. GUN GROUP. WAR DEPARTMENT LUBRICATION ORDER NO. 4001 (FIG 31)
SHOWS THE PARTS WHICH REQUIRE LUBRICATION, THE LUBRICANTS, AND THE
INTERVALS.

(1) LUBRICANTS. GREASE, GENERAL PURPOSE, NO. 1 IS USED, EXCEPT FOR
TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING, WHEN GREASE, GENERAL PURPOSE. NO. 0 IS
USED. THE BEARING SURFACES SHOULD BE LIGHTLY COATED WITH THE GREASE.

(2) FREQUENCY OF LUBRICATION. THE SURFACES OF THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY
WHICH TOUCH THE SPRING CASE SHOULD BE LUBRICATED AFTER EACH USE OF
THE WEAPON. OTHER PARTS ARE LUBRICATED AFTER SIX FIRING MISSIONS, SIX
TRAINING SESSIONS, OR OFTENER. ALL SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY CLEANED (PARS
52, 55, AND 56) WITH GASOLINE, DRY CLEANING SOLVENT, OR OTHER SOLVENT,
THEN DRIED BEFORE LUBRICATION. IF THE GUN IS DISASSEMBLED FOR ANY OTHER
REASON, IT SHOULD BE LUBRICATED BEFORE REASSEMBLY.

(3) RECORDS. TO ASCERTAIN WHEN SIX MISSIONS HAVE BEEN FIRED, A RECORD
OF FIRING (PAR 2) SHOULD BE KEPT WITH EACH FLAME THROWER.

B. TANK GROUP. THE TANK GROUP ORDINARILY REQUIRES NO LUBRICATION.
HOWEVER, IT MAY UNDER THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES:

(1) IF THE TANK GROUP HAS BEEN IMMERSED IN WATER FOR SEVERAL HOURS,
THE FLEXIBLE SHAFT OF THE PRESSURE VALVE MAY HAVE LOST ITS LUBRICANT.
IF SO, REMOVE THE SHAFT (PAR 66 B) AND INSPECT. IF LUBRICANT IS NOT
PRESENT, AS INDICATED BY DIFFICULTY OF MOVEMENT AFTER REMOVAL, DIP
THE SHAFT IN SOLVENT TO CLEAN AND THEN DIP IN WARMED GREASE, GENERAL
PURPOSE, NO. 1. REPLACE SHAFT IN VALVE.

(2) IF FILLING OR SAFETY-HEAD PLUGS (FIGS 39 AND 40) TEND TO STICK
TO FUEL TANKS, APPLY GREASE, GENERAL PURPOSE, NO. 1 (NO. 0 IF BELOW
FREEZING TEMPERATURES) BEFORE REPLACING PLUGS.

SECTION XIV PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES

50. GENERAL

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES, AS PRESCRIBED BY ARMY REGULATIONS,
ARE A FUNCTION OF USING ORGANIZATION ECHELONS OF MAINTENANCE. THESE
SERVICES CONSIST OF:

A. BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER OPERATION SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE
FIRERS AND ASSISTANTS.

B. SCHEDULED SERVICES PERFORMED BY ORGANIZATIONAL MAINTENANCE
PERSONNEL (SERVICE WHEN FILLING AND CHARGING, AND SERVICE AFTER SIX
FIRING MISSIONS).

51. BEFORE-OPERATION SERVICE OF TANK GROUP.

THE FOLLOWING SERVICES ARE TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE FILLING, CHARGING,
AND LOADING THE FLAME THROWER WITH PRESSURE, FUEL, AND IGNITION
CYLINDER:

A. PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. OPEN AND CLOSE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE TO TEST
FOR EASE OF OPERATION.

B. THREADED CONNECTIONS. CHECK ALL THREADED CONNECTIONS FOR
TIGHTNESS, USING APPROPRIATE WRENCHES.

C. TANK COUPLING. EXAMINE COUPLING FOR CLEANLINESS AND EASE OF
MOVEMENT OF LOCK AND CAMS. (PAR 70) CLEAN IF NECESSARY. IF WASHER IS
BROKEN, REPLACE, USING SCREW DRIVER TO PRY OUT.

D. PLUGS. CHECK FILLING PLUG AND SAFETY-HEAD PLUG FOR COMPLETENESS
OF PARTS (PAR 69 A) AND CLEANLINESS OF THREADS AND SEATS. CLEAN, IF
NECESSARY, WITH CLOTH. IF ROD OR ROD AND CHAIN HAVE BROKEN OFF AND
FALLEN IN TANK, TURN TANK UPSIDE DOWN AND REMOVE. REMOVE DEFLECTOR
TUBE FROM HEAD (USING HAND, NOT WRENCH). INSPECT TO SEE IF DIAPHRAGM
IS INTACT. IF DIAPHRAGM IS RUPTURED, REPLACE THE SAFETY HEAD WITH AN
UNBROKEN HEAD. (PAR 69 B, C) REASSEMBLE PLUG, HEAD, AND DEFLECTOR TUBE
IN LEFT FUEL TANK. (FIG 11) TUBE SHOULD FACE TO REAR AND AT A 45-DEGREE
ANGLE TO OPERATORS LEFT SHOULDER. (FIG 18) SCREW IN DEFLECTOR TUBE BY
HAND; DO NOT USE WRENCH ON DEFLECTOR TUBE. TIGHTEN LOCK NUT WITH WRENCH.

E. PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP. THE CLAMP SHOULD HOLD THE PRESSURE TANK
TIGHTLY IN PLACE. IF TANK IS LOOSE, A WOODEN SPLINT OR WEDGE UNDER THE
CLAMP MAY BE USED AS A TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT.

F. CARRIER-FRAME BOLTS. CHECK TIGHTNESS. USE WRENCH.

G. CARRIER. (PAR 71) EXAMINE ALL CANVAS, WEBBING, AND CORD FOR SIGNS
OF MILDEW, ROT, OR WEAR. REPLACE DEFECTIVE PARTS. MOVE FLAME THROWER TO
DRYER STORAGE IF MILDEW OCCURS.

H. CORD (LASHING). CHECK FOR TIGHTNESS. IF NECESSARY, MAKE TIGHTER
AND USE SECURE, SLIP-PROOF KNOTS. WHEN THE TANK GROUP IS FILLED WITH
FUEL AND ADJUSTED ON THE FIRER, ITS WEIGHT SHOULD BE CARRIED CHIEFLY BY
THE CANVAS AND WEBBING, NOT BY THE METAL FRAME.

I. SHOULDER AND BODY STRAPS. ADJUST STRAPS TO FIT FIRER. (PARS 19 AND
71) A LOOSE TANK GROUP CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT OR INJURY WHEN THE WEARER
CHANGES POSITIONS WHILE ON A MISSION. CHECK PRESENCE AND CONDITION OF
THE TWO PINS AND TWO COTTER PINS WHICH HOLD SHOULDER STRAPS TO STEEL
SUPPORT. CHECK FASTENERS.

52. BEFORE-OPERATION SERVICE OF GUN GROUP.

THE FOLLOWING SERVICES ARE TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE FILLING, CHARGING,
AND LOADING WITH PRESSURE, FUEL, AND IGNITION CYLINDER:

A. HOSE NIPPLE, TANK END. EXAMINE TO BE SURE NIPPLE IS CLEAN AND
NOT BADLY NICKED. IF BADLY NICKED, THE NIPPLE MAY NOT MAKE A TIGHT
SEAL AT THE TANK COUPLING. A LEAK AND LOSS OF PRESSURE MAY RESULT. SEE
PARAGRAPH 73 D FOR REPAIR OF THE NIPPLE.

B. FUEL HOSE. EXAMINE SURFACE OF HOSE FOR CRACKS OR OTHER SIGNS OF
DETERIORATION. SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO PORTIONS ADJACENT TO
THE GUN AND TANK COUPLING, WHICH ARE SUBJECTED TO SEVERE FLEXING. IF
HOSE IS DEFECTIVE, REPLACE. (PAR 73 B, C) DO NOT PATCH.

C. HOSE NIPPLE, GUN END. CHECK TIGHTNESS OF THREADED CONNECTION
BETWEEN HOSE AND FUEL-VALVE BODY, USING HAND OR VERY LIGHT WRENCH
PRESSURE.

D. SHIELD. REMOVE IGNITION SHIELD. CHECK CLEANLINESS OF THREADS
ON SHIELD AND ON IGNITION-HEAD BODY. IF NOT CLEAN, USE CLOTH. WHEN
REASSEMBLING (PAR 18 C), SHIELD SHOULD TURN FREELY UNTIL IT LOCKS IN
CORRECT POSITION.

E. VALVE LEVER AND NEEDLE.

(1) THERE SHOULD BE SOME PLAY IN THE VALVE LEVER. TO TEST, REMOVE
IGNITION SHIELD. COMPRESS GRIP SAFETY AND VALVE LEVER SLOWLY,
OBSERVING THE MOTION OF THE VALVE NEEDLE. THE VALVE LEVER SHOULD MOVE
APPROXIMATELY 1/16 INCH BEFORE THE NEEDLE BEGINS TO MOVE.

(2) VALVE NEEDLE SHOULD BE SEATED FIRMLY IN THE BARREL NOZZLE. AFTER
THE VALVE LEVER IS PULLED BACK AND RELEASED, NO PLAY SHOULD OCCUR IN
THE NEEDLE. FOR ADJUSTMENT OF NEEDLE, SEE PARAGRAPH 75 D.

F. SCREWS. USE SCREW DRIVER TO TEST TIGHTNESS OF ALL SCREWS.

G. SPRING RETAINER AND PLUG. CHECK TIGHTNESS OF SPRING RETAINER AND
PLUG (FIG 47) BY USING HAND OR VERY LIGHT WRENCH PRESSURE.

H. IGNITION HEAD. ALL EXPOSED SURFACES OF THE SHIELD, NOZZLE, NEEDLE,
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE IGNITION HEAD, OR ADJACENT TO IT, SHOULD BE
CLEAN. IF NOT, USE CLOTH.

I. ATOMIZER HOLE. WITH THE FUEL VALVE HELD FULLY OPEN, INSERT A
FINE WIRE IN THE ATOMIZER HOLE OF THE NOZZLE TO CLEAN THE HOLE. THEN
USE CLOTH-WRAPPED SPLINT TO REMOVE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE NOZZLE ANY
FOREIGN MATTER PUSHED THROUGH THE ATOMIZER HOLE. IF SUCH MATTER IS NOT
REMOVED, IT MAY INTERFERE WITH THE CLOSING OF THE FUEL VALVE NEEDLE AT
THE NOZZLE. REPEAT PROCEDURE IN E (2) ABOVE.

J. SPRING CASE. SPRING CASE SHOULD TURN FREELY ON IGNITION HEAD. IF
IT DOES NOT, CLEAN ANY GREASE OR DIRT FROM, SURFACES WITH CLOTH AND
RELUBRICATE. (PAR 49)

K. TRIGGER. PULL TRIGGER ONCE OR TWICE TO FIND WHETHER IT OPERATES
EASILY AND WHETHER IT RETURNS TO POSITION. IF NOT, CLEAN AND LUBRICATE
TRIGGER. (PAR 49) CHECK CONDITION OF TRIGGER SPRING.

L. TRIGGER ROD. CHECK POSITION OF THE TRIGGER ROD WHEN TRIGGER
IS PULLED BACK ALL THE WAY AS WHEN FIRING. THE ROD SHOULD EXTEND
APPROXIMATELY 1/16 INCH BEYOND THE END OF THE LUG IN THE IGNITION HEAD.
IF IT DOES NOT, BEND THE ROD SLIGHTLY, REVERSE POSITION OF BEARING, OR
REPLACE WORN PARTS.

53. SERVICE WHEN FILLING AND CHARGING.

A. INSPECTION OF FUEL TANKS. JUST BEFORE FILLING AND CHARGING, REMOVE
PLUGS (PAR 69 B) AND EXAMINE INTERIOR OF FUEL TANKS TO SEE WHETHER
THEY ARE CLEAN AND FREE FROM FOREIGN MATTER. IF NOT CLEAN, FLUSH WITH
GASOLINE UNTIL CLEAN.

B. FUEL LEVEL. WHEN FILLING (PARS 37 THROUGH 40), SEE THAT FUEL
REACHES THE SAME LEVEL IN BOTH TANKS. IF LEVELING DOES NOT OCCUR,
THE TANK CONNECTOR MAY BE CLOGGED WITH FOREIGN MATTER. IF SO, CLEAN,
AS IN A, ABOVE. AFTER FILLING, WIPE PLUG SEATS WITH A CLOTH BEFORE
REPLACING PLUGS. WIPE ANY SPILLED FUEL FROM WEAPON.

C. PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. BEFORE CHARGING THE TANK GROUP WITH AIR OR
NITROGEN, OPEN AND CLOSE THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE SEVERAL TIMES BY HAND
TO BE SURE IT OPERATES FREELY. IF IT DOES NOT, ADJUST AS DESCRIBED IN
PARAGRAPH 66 D.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 32. TESTING PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE, USING
0-3,000-POUND TESTING GAGE FROM SERVICE KIT.]

D. TESTING FOR LEAKS IN PRESSURE SYSTEM. AFTER CHARGING, AND AS FEW
HOURS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE A MISSION, USE AN 0-3,000-POUND GAGE FURNISHED
IN SERVICE KIT TO TEST PRESSURE. (FIG 32) TO INSTALL GAGE, UNSCREW
CHECK-VALVE CAP AND SCREW GAGE IN CHECK-VALVE BODY. IF PRESSURE HAS
FALLEN BELOW THAT TO WHICH THE TANK WAS CHARGED (PAR 32), A LEAK IS
INDICATED. REMOVE GAGE, REPLACE CHECK-VALVE CAP, AND CHECK FOR LEAKS
AT JOINTS BETWEEN PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE AND BETWEEN TANK VALVE AND
CHECK VALVE. (A WRENCH SHOULD BE USED TO TIGHTEN CAP ON CHECK-VALVE
BODY SO AS TO AVOID PRODUCING AN ADDITIONAL LEAK.) LARGE LEAKS CAN
BE FELT OR HEARD. SMALL LEAKS CAN BE DETECTED BY COATING JOINTS WITH
SOAP-AND-WATER SOLUTION. BUBBLES INDICATE LEAKS. IF A LEAK IS REVEALED
BETWEEN PRESSURE TANK AND PRESSURE-TANK VALVE, OR BETWEEN CHECK VALVE
AND PRESSURE-TANK VALVE, REPLACE ALL THREE AS A UNIT. IF TESTS DO NOT
SHOW UP THE LEAK THE TANK MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY CHARGED. IT SHOULD
BE RECHARGED AND THEN RETESTED.

54. SERVICE WHEN FIRING.

A. FAILURE TO IGNITE. PULL TRIGGER REPEATEDLY. IF IGNITION CYLINDER
STILL FAILS TO IGNITE, DIRT MAY BE WEDGED IN IGNITION HEAD. UNSCREW
SHIELD ONE-HALF TURN. SCREW IT BACK, RAPPING SHIELD WITH THE HAND WHILE
TURNING. THIS SHOULD DISLODGE FOREIGN MATTER. PULL TRIGGER AGAIN.
REPEAT PROCEDURE, IF NECESSARY.

B. SAFETY HEAD BLOWS (BREAKS). IF SAFETY HEAD BREAKS, FIRING
MISSION CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT. ON RETURN, HAVE HEAD REPLACED. (PAR 69)
FOLLOW TEST PROCEDURE. (PAR 56 B)

55. SERVICE AFTER FIRING.

A. UNLOADING. REMOVE IGNITION CYLINDER (PAR 30), CLOSE PRESSURE-TANK
VALVE, AND BLOW OUT REMAINING FUEL AND PRESSURE. (PAR 30)

B. REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT. RELEASE THE BODY STRAPS, THEN THE SHOULDER
STRAPS. IF PRONE, LIE ON SIDE AND ALLOW TANK GROUP TO ROLL OFF ONTO
GROUND. IF STANDING OR KNEELING, TAKE CARE THAT TANK GROUP DOES NOT
DROP ON FEET OR LEGS.

C. CORRECTING OR REPORTING. CORRECT ANY FAILURES OR DIFFICULTIES OR
REPORT THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO SERVICE OR MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.

D. GUN. REMOVE SHIELD (PAR 18) AND CLEAN INTERIOR OF SHIELD WITH
CLOTH. CLEAN HOLES IN SHIELD WITH WIRE OR WOODEN SPLINT. CLEAN EXTERNAL
SURFACES OF BARREL, NOZZLE, NEEDLE, AND OTHER PARTS. CHECK CLEANLINESS
AND ADJUSTMENT OF NEEDLE. (PAR 75 D) CHECK TRIGGER FOR OPERATION.
LUBRICATE. (PAR 49)

E. FUEL TANKS AND PASSAGES. REMOVE PLUGS (PAR 69 B). DRAIN
ANY REMAINING FUEL. USE GASOLINE TO REMOVE RESIDUES OF THICKENED
FUELS BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO HARDEN AND OBSTRUCT PASSAGES. IF
NECESSARY, FILL TANKS WITH GASOLINE AND ALLOW TO STAND FOR SEVERAL
HOURS, SHAKING OCCASIONALLY. DRAIN AND REPEAT IF NECESSARY.

F. SAFETY HEAD. CHECK HEAD TO SEE IF IT IS RUPTURED; IF IT IS,
REPLACE. (PAR 69) FOLLOW TEST PROCEDURE. (PAR 56 B)

G. PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. IF WEAPON IS TO BE STORED, OPEN PRESSURE-TANK
VALVE AND LEAVE IT OPEN UNTIL NEXT CHARGING.

H. CARRIER. SCRUB, IF NECESSARY, WITH SOAP AND WATER, OR GASOLINE.

I. EXTERIOR METAL SURFACES. SCRUB EXTERIOR METAL SURFACES CLEAN OF
FUEL TO PREVENT FIRE HAZARD. ALLOW TO DRY BEFORE USING AGAIN.

J. GENERAL INSPECTION. CAREFULLY EXAMINE ALL OTHER PARTS, ADJUST AS
NECESSARY, AND REPLACE ANY WHICH ARE DAMAGED.

56. SERVICE AFTER SIX FIRING MISSIONS.

AFTER THE FLAME THROWER HAS BEEN USED ON SIX FIRING MISSIONS OR THE
EQUIVALENT IN TRAINING WORK, EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL SHOULD FOLLOW THESE
DIRECTIONS:

PLUG IN SEAT WITH WRENCH.

(6) FULLY CHARGE PRESSURE TANK. (PAR 32)

(7) IF TEST FIRING WITH FUEL, LOAD IGNITION CYLINDER. (PAR 18)

(8) OPEN PRESSURE-TANK VALVE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVE PRESSURE IN
FUEL TANKS BY READING GAGE. THE GAGE INDICATES THE PRESSURE IN BOTH
TANKS. IT SHOULD BE BETWEEN 350 AND 390 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.

(9) READ THE GAGE AT THE EXPIRATION OF NOT LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. THE
TANKS SHOULD HAVE A PRESSURE READING OF NOT MORE THAN 390 POUNDS. IF
THE PRESSURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE BEYOND 390 POUNDS AND THE SAFETY
HEAD BLOWS, REPLACE THE SAFETY HEAD AND THE PRESSURE REGULATOR.

(10) FIRE BY OPERATING CONTROLS (OR SIMULATE FIRING IF TANKS ARE FILLED
WITH WATER). THE BURST SHOULD LAST 3 SECONDS, DURING WHICH TIME THE
PRESSURE SHOULD NOT DROP BELOW 260 POUNDS.

(11) IF THE PRESSURE DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS STATED IN
(8), (9), AND (10), ADJUST THE PRESSURE REGULATOR UPWARD OR DOWNWARD.
(PAR 67 D)

(12) WHILE THE ABOVE TEST FIRING IS PROCEEDING, CHECK FOR LEAKS AT ALL
JOINTS AND CONNECTIONS ON THE TANK GROUP. THE PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD
BE CHECKED BY PAINTING THE JOINTS WITH SOAP-AND-WATER SOLUTION AND BY
LOOKING FOR BUBBLES WHICH INDICATE LEAKS. FOR REPLACEMENT OF PARTS
WHERE PRESSURE LEAKS, SEE PARAGRAPH 66. FUEL LEAKS MAY BE SEEN WITHOUT
SOAP AND WATER. FOR REPAIR OF FUEL LEAKS, SEE PARAGRAPH 75 E. THE
NOZZLE SHOULD BE OBSERVED BY REMOVING THE IGNITION SHIELD. NOZZLE
LEAKS ARE CORRECTED BY CLEANING, ADJUSTING NEEDLE (PAR 75 D), OR BY
REGRINDING. (PAR 75 E) IF THIS IS NOT SUCCESSFUL, REPLACE BOTH NEEDLE
AND BARREL AS A UNIT.

C. FUEL VALVE. DISCHARGE ALL PRESSURE FROM THE GUN BY OPERATING THE
FUEL VALVE. CAREFULLY REMOVE THE VALVE GRIP AND GRIP SUPPORT. (PAR

SECTION XVI TANK GROUP

65. GENERAL.

THE TANK GROUP STORES FUEL AND PRESSURE. THE FUEL IS PLACED UNDER
PRESSURE WHEN THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE IS OPENED. THE TANK GROUP IS
SUPPORTED UPON THE FIRERS BACK AND SHOULDERS BY THE CARRIER.

66. PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. THE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY
(FIG 33) INCLUDES:

(1) PRESSURE TANK. THE PRESSURE TANK IS A LIGHTWEIGHT, AIRPLANE-TYPE
CYLINDER, ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE GREAT PRESSURE WHICH IT CONTAINS. THE
TANK IS CHARGED WITH AIR OR NITROGEN AT 1,700 TO 2,100 POUNDS PER
SQUARE INCH PRESSURE BY USE OF AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT AS DESCRIBED IN
PARAGRAPHS 31 AND 32. THIS PRESSURE STAYS IN THE PRESSURE TANK UNTIL
THE WEAPON IS READY TO BE FIRED. OPENING OF THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE
RELEASES AIR OR NITROGEN THROUGH THE PRESSURE REGULATOR TO THE FUEL
TANKS. OXYGEN OR COMBUSTIBLE GASES ARE NEVER USED IN THE TANK BECAUSE A
VIOLENT EXPLOSION MAY RESULT. THE TANK IS LARGE IN CAPACITY TO ASSURE
AMPLE PRESSURE, AND HENCE FULL RANGE, FOR THE ENTIRE LOAD OF FUEL.
THE PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP (FIG 39), A STEEL-STRAP DEVICE WITH HINGE AND
TOGGLE-TYPE LATCH, HOLDS THE PRESSURE TANK IN PLACE ON THE FUEL TANKS.

(2) PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. (FIGS 33 AND 34) THIS VALVE IS SCREWED
INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRESSURE TANK. THE VALVE STEM SLIDES INTO THE
VALVE END OF THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT. WHEN OPENED BY MEANS OF THE
VALVE HANDLE AND VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT, THE VALVE PERMITS PASSAGE OF
COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN THROUGH TUBES AND THE PRESSURE REGULATOR TO
THE FUEL TANKS. THE VALVE IS OF THE QUICK-OPENING, PACKLESS, DIAPHRAGM
TYPE.

(3) PRESSURE-VALVE HANDLE AND VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT. (FIGS 33 AND 34)
THE PRESSURE-VALVE HANDLE IS HELD BY A SMALL NUT ON THE END OF THE
VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT, WHICH IN TURN IS CONNECTED TO THE PRESSURE-TANK
VALVE BY MEANS OF THE VALVE STEM AND A LARGE HEX NUT. THE HANDLE AND
SHAFT EXTEND TO THE RIGHT OF THE TANK GROUP, ENABLING THE FIRER TO OPEN
AND CLOSE THE VALVE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE WHEN CARRYING THE WEAPON. THE
HANDLE SLIPS OVER THE END OF THE SHAFT AND IS HELD TO IT BY A NUT. THE
SHAFT IS HELD TO ONE OF THE FUEL TANKS BY A CLAMP, NUT, AND BOLT WELDED
TO THE TANK.

(4) CHECK VALVE. (FIGS 33 THROUGH 35) THE CHECK VALVE HAS THE SAME
FUNCTION AS THE VALVE ON A VEHICULAR TIRE TUBE, BUT IT IS MUCH HEAVIER
IN CONSTRUCTION AND DIFFERENT IN DESIGN BECAUSE THE PRESSURE IN THE
FLAME THROWER IS 50 TIMES GREATER THAN THAT IN AN AUTOMOBILE TIRE TUBE.
CONNECTED BY THREADS TO THE PRESSURE VALVE, THE CHECK VALVE PERMITS
COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN TO ENTER THE PRESSURE TANK DURING CHARGING
(PARS 31 AND 32) BUT PREVENTS ITS ESCAPE WHEN THE OUTSIDE SOURCE OF
PRESSURE IS REMOVED. THE CAP IS REMOVED FROM THE CHECK VALVE ONLY FOR
CHARGING OR TESTING.

B. REMOVAL. (FIG 33) TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THREADS, LEAKS, AND LOSS OF
PRESSURE AND RANGE, REMOVE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY ONLY WHEN
NECESSARY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 33. PRESSURE SYSTEM DISASSEMBLED, SHOWING
NOMENCLATURE AND CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE STOCK NUMBERS FOR
REQUISITIONING SPARE PARTS.]

(1) RELEASE OF PRESSURE. BE SURE ALL PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELEASED
FROM THE PRESSURE SYSTEM BEFORE DISASSEMBLING OR REMOVING ANY PART OR
ASSEMBLY OF THE PRESSURE SYSTEM. TO RELEASE PRESSURE, OPERATE FUEL
VALVE (PAR 26) AND HOLD OPEN UNTIL PRESSURE IS EXHAUSTED. AS AN
ADDED PRECAUTION, PERSONNEL SHOULD AVOID FACING THE CONNECTIONS WHEN
DISCONNECTING PARTS OR ASSEMBLIES.

(2) REMOVAL PROCEDURE. AFTER RELEASE OF ALL PRESSURE:

 (A) LOOSEN THE CLAMP FROM THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT.

 (B) USING WRENCH, UNSCREW THE LARGE HEX NUT WHICH HOLDS THE
 FLEXIBLE SHAFT ON THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE.

 (C) PULL THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT AND HANDLE FREE OF THE VALVE.

 (D) USING WRENCH, UNSCREW THE FLARED TUBE NUT ON THE REGULATOR TUBE
 ADJACENT TO THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE.

 (E) OPEN PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP (FIG 39) AND SWING CLAMP STRAP OUTWARD.

 (F) REMOVE THE PRESSURE TANK TOGETHER WITH THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE
 AND CHECK VALVE.

 (G) TO REMOVE VALVE HANDLE, USE THE ADJUSTABLE-END WRENCH TO LOOSEN
 AND REMOVE NUT FROM THREADED OUTER END OF VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT. SLIDE
 OUT THE VALVE HANDLE.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 34. LOWER PORTION OF PRESSURE SYSTEM, ASSEMBLED.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 35. CHECK VALVE (CROSS SECTION).]

C. INSTALLATION. (FIGS 33 AND 39) TO INSTALL:

 (1) INSERT PRESSURE TANK (WITH PRESSURE-TANK VALVE AND CHECK VALVE
 MOUNTED ON THE TANK) THROUGH THE PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP. BE SURE TO
 ALINE THE REGULATOR TUBE, ELBOW, AND PRESSURE-TANK VALVE THREADS
 CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY CANNOT BE DAMAGED WHEN CONNECTING.

 (2) CLOSE THE PRESSURE-TANK CLAMP.

 (3) START THE THREADED CONNECTIONS BY HAND TO BE SURE THEY ARE WELL
 ALINED. DO NOT FORCE. USE WRENCH FOR FINAL TIGHTENING, BUT DO NOT
 APPLY GREAT TORQUE TO THE WRENCH.

 (4) INSERT THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT THROUGH SMALL CLAMP INTO THE
 PRESSURE-TANK VALVE. USING WRENCH, TIGHTEN THE LARGE HEX NUT LOCATED
 BETWEEN SHAFT AND VALVE.

 (5) TIGHTEN THE CLAMP ON THE VALVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT.

 (6) PLACE PRESSURE-VALVE HANDLE ON THREADED END OF THE SHAFT. PLACE
 NUT ON THREADED END AND TIGHTEN WITH ADJUSTABLE-END WRENCH.

D. ADJUSTMENT. IF VALVE HANDLE CANNOT BE TURNED BY HAND:

 (1) REMOVE FLEXIBLE SHAFT AND HANDLE. NEVER APPLY A WRENCH TO THESE
 PARTS.

 (2) TURN END OF PRESSURE-VALVE STEM WITH WRENCH TO OPEN VALVE.

 (3) IF STEM WILL NOT TURN, REPLACE THE TANK AND VALVE.

 (4) IF STEM TURNS, WORK IT BACK AND FORTH WITH WRENCH.

 (5) RECONNECT FLEXIBLE SHAFT AND HANDLE.

 (6) IF HANDLE DOES NOT TURN EASILY, REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL HANDLE
 TURNS, OR REPLACE TANK AND VALVE.

 (7) CLOSE VALVE BEFORE CHARGING TANK.

E. MAINTENANCE.

 (1) IF EITHER PRESSURE TANK, PRESSURE-TANK VALVE, OR CHECK VALVE
 ARE DAMAGED OR DEFECTIVE, ALL THREE MUST BE REPLACED AS A UNIT.
 NO ATTEMPT MAY BE MADE TO REPAIR ANY OF THESE PARTS OR THEIR
 CONNECTIONS. IF MAKESHIFT REPAIRS OR IMPROVISED PARTS ARE DEVISED,
 SERIOUS ACCIDENTS CAN RESULT BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY HIGH PRESSURES
 TO WHICH THE EQUIPMENT IS SUBJECTED.

 (2) KEEP ALL THREADED CONNECTIONS TIGHTENED. IF A LEAK IS SUSPECTED
 AT ANY THREADED CONNECTION, FOLLOW PROCEDURE IN PARAGRAPH 53 D.

67. PRESSURE REGULATOR.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. THE REGULATOR AUTOMATICALLY REDUCES
THE VARIABLE PRESSURE OF AIR OR NITROGEN IN THE PRESSURE TANK TO A
CONSTANT OPERATING PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 350 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH
IN THE FUEL TANKS. THE REGULATOR IS LOCATED AT A PROTECTED POSITION
IN THE TANK GROUP OF THE M2-2 PORTABLE FLAME THROWER, WHERE IT IS NOT
READILY SUBJECT TO TAMPERING OR DAMAGE FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE REGULATOR
TUBE WITH FITTINGS CONNECTS THE PRESSURE-TANK VALVE AND PRESSURE
REGULATOR. (FIG 33) ITS OUTLET IS CONNECTED TO THE FUEL TANKS BY THE
DIFFUSION-PIPE ASSEMBLY. (PAR 68 A) EITHER OF TWO INTERCHANGEABLE
TYPES OF REGULATORS IS FURNISHED: THE SPRING TYPE (FIGS 33, 36, AND

68. FUEL-TANK ASSEMBLY.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIGS 4, 5, AND 39) THE FUEL-TANK
ASSEMBLY INCLUDES:

 (1) FUEL TANKS. TWO ALLOY STEEL FUEL TANKS HOLD THE FUEL BEFORE IT
 IS PROPELLED TO THE TARGET. THEY HAVE A COMBINED CAPACITY, INCLUDING
 VOID, OF 4-1/2 GALLONS. A VOID OF APPROXIMATELY 1/2 GALLON IS LEFT
 IN TANKS WHEN FILLING TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION AND TO PERMIT ENTRY OF
 THE COMPRESSED NITROGEN OR AIR. TO SPEED FILLING AND CLEANING OF
 THE TANKS, TWO OPENINGS ARE PROVIDED ON TOP OF THE FUEL TANKS. THE
 OPENINGS ARE THREADED TO RECEIVE THE FILLING-PLUG ASSEMBLY AND THE
 SAFETY-HEAD PLUG ASSEMBLY, WHICH ARE INTERCHANGEABLE IN THE OPENINGS.
 FILLING OPERATIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF AUXILIARY EQUIPMENT AND ARE
 DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS 34 THROUGH 40. THE CARRIER AND THE PRESSURE
 SYSTEM ARE SUPPORTED ON THE FUEL TANKS.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 39. FUEL SYSTEM OF TANK GROUP AND RELATED PARTS
DISASSEMBLED, SHOWING NOMENCLATURE AND CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE STOCK
NUMBERS FOR REQUISITIONING SPARE PARTS.]

 (2) TANK CONNECTOR. THIS OPEN PASSAGEWAY BETWEEN THE FUEL TANKS
 MAKES THEM, IN EFFECT, A SINGLE CONTAINER. THE LOCATION OF THE
 TANK CONNECTOR AND ITS LARGE DIAMETER PERMIT EASY FLOW OF FUEL AND
 PRESSURE BETWEEN THE TWO TANKS.

 (3) HOSE CONNECTOR. THE HOSE CONNECTOR IS THE OUTLET FOR FUEL
 FROM THE FUEL TANKS. IT IS LOCATED SO THAT NEARLY ALL THE FUEL IS
 PROPELLED FROM THE WEAPON IF FIRING POSITIONS ARE CORRECT. (PAR 24)
 ONE END IS WELDED TO AN OPENING IN THE TANK CONNECTOR. THE OTHER END
 IS THREADED INTO THE TANK COUPLING.

 (4) FRAME CLAMP. THIS SMALL METAL CLAMP, WITH BOLT, NUT, AND
 WASHER, HOLDS THE HOSE CONNECTOR TO THE CARRIER FRAME.

 (5) DIFFUSION-PIPE ASSEMBLY. THIS T-SHAPED TUBING CARRIES
 COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN FROM THE PRESSURE REGULATOR TO EACH OF THE
 FUEL TANKS. A FLARED TUBE CONNECTION AND ELBOW CONNECT THE STEM OF
 THE T TO THE PRESSURE REGULATOR. THE HORIZONTAL TUBES OF THE T EXTEND
 INTO THE FUEL TANKS AND ARE WELDED TO THE FUEL TANK WALLS. WITHIN THE
 FUEL TANKS THESE TUBES ARE PERFORATED WITH HOLES WHICH PERMIT READY
 ESCAPE OF THE COMPRESSED NITROGEN OR AIR INTO THE FUEL TANKS WHEN THE
 PRESSURE-TANK VALVE IS OPEN.

B. REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION. THE TANK CONNECTOR, HOSE CONNECTOR,
DIFFUSION-PIPE ASSEMBLY, AND THE TWO FUEL TANKS ARE WELDED TOGETHER AND
CANNOT BE DISASSEMBLED FROM EACH OTHER. NO ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO
REMOVE ANY OF THESE PARTS OR ASSEMBLIES.

C. MAINTENANCE. OTHER THAN CLEANING (PARS 51 D AND 55 E),
REPAINTING, AND TIGHTENING OF THREADED JOINTS, NO REPAIRS WILL BE
ATTEMPTED BY THE FIRST OR SECOND ECHELON ON THE FUEL TANKS, TANK AND
HOSE CONNECTORS, OR DIFFUSION-PIPE ASSEMBLY. EMERGENCY REPAIRS MAY BE
MADE ONLY BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH ECHELON. NO ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO
WELD OR PATCH ANY PART OF THE FUEL TANKS.

69. FILLING AND SAFETY-HEAD PLUG ASSEMBLIES.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING.

 (1) FILLING-PLUG ASSEMBLY. (FIG 39) THIS ASSEMBLY FITS INTO THE
 1-3/8-INCH THREADED OPENING AT THE TOP OF EITHER ONE OF THE FUEL
 TANKS. IT PERMITS FILLING AND CLEANING OF THE TANKS, AND SEALS THE
 OPENING WHEN THE TANK IS NOT BEING FILLED OR CLEANED. THE ASSEMBLY
 INCLUDES THE FILLING PLUG PROPER AND A PLUG-RETAINER ASSEMBLY. THE
 LATTER IS A METAL ROD WHICH HANGS FROM THE PLUG ON A METAL CHAIN. THE
 ROD AND CHAIN PREVENT ACCIDENTAL LOSS OF THE PLUG.

 (2) SAFETY-HEAD PLUG ASSEMBLY. (FIGS 39 AND 40) THIS ASSEMBLY IS
 SCREWED INTO THE THREADED OPENING ON TOP OF EITHER FUEL TANK. IT
 SERVES THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS THE FILLING-PLUG ASSEMBLY AND MOREOVER
 PROTECTS THE FIRER AND OTHER PERSONNEL. IT INCLUDES:

 (A) SAFETY-HEAD PLUG. THIS PLUG IS SIMILAR TO THE FILLING PLUG
 EXCEPT FOR THE THREADED HOLE WHICH RECEIVES THE SAFETY HEAD.

 (B) SAFETY HEAD. THIS METAL HEAD SCREWS INTO THE SAFETY-HEAD
 PLUG. IT INCLUDES A SOFT METAL DIAPHRAGM WHICH BURSTS WHEN THE
 PRESSURE IN THE FUEL TANKS EXCEEDS 500 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. IT
 PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP OF DANGEROUS PRESSURES IN THE FUEL TANKS.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 40. SAFETY-HEAD PLUG ASSEMBLY (CROSS SECTION).]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 41. UNSCREWING SAFETY HEAD FROM SAFETY-HEAD PLUG,
USING WRENCH.]

 (C) DEFLECTOR TUBE. THIS SHORT, CURVED PIECE OF 1/8-INCH PIPE
 DEFLECTS FUEL AND PRESSURE AWAY FROM THE FIRER IF THE SAFETY HEAD
 BURSTS. A LOCK NUT HOLDS THE TUBE IN POSITION. (PAR 12 J)

 (D) PLUG-RETAINER ASSEMBLY. THIS ASSEMBLY CONSISTS OF A METAL
 ROD AND CHAIN WHICH HANG FROM THE PLUG AND PREVENT ACCIDENTAL LOSS
 OF THE PLUG WHEN FILLING OR INSPECTING.

B. REMOVAL OF PLUGS.

 (1) BEFORE REMOVING THE FILLING PLUG, THE SAFETY-HEAD PLUG, OR AN
 UNBROKEN SAFETY HEAD, OPERATE THE FUEL VALVE UNTIL ANY PRESSURE WHICH
 MAY HAVE ACCUMULATED IN THE FUEL TANKS IS ELIMINATED. IF THE COUPLING
 PLUG IS IN THE TANK COUPLING, VERY SLIGHTLY LOOSEN THE THREADS OF
 EITHER THE FILLING PLUG OR THE SAFETY-HEAD PLUG, USING THE 1-3/4-INCH
 WRENCH, TO ELIMINATE PRESSURE IN THE FUEL TANKS. KEEP FACE AND EYES
 AWAY FROM THE THREADS.

 (2) THE PLUG-RETAINER ASSEMBLIES SHOULD NOT BE LIFTED COMPLETELY OUT
 OF THE TANKS UNLESS REQUIRED.

 (3) IF EITHER THE ROD OR THE ROD AND CHAIN BREAKS FROM ONE OF THE
 PLUGS AND FALLS INTO THE TANK, UPEND THE TANK GROUP TO PERMIT REMOVAL
 OF THE PARTS.

 (4) TO REPLACE BURST SAFETY HEAD, UNSCREW LOCK NUT AND DEFLECTOR
 TUBE. (FIG 11) USING WRENCH (FIG 41), UNSCREW SAFETY HEAD. NEVER
 DISASSEMBLE THE SAFETY HEAD.

C. INSTALLATION OF PLUGS. THE FILLING PLUG, SAFETY-HEAD PLUG, AND
SAFETY HEAD ARE SCREWED IN BY HAND AND THEN TIGHTENED WITH WRENCHES. NO
SUBSTITUTION WILL BE MADE FOR THE SAFETY HEAD, WHICH IS MANUFACTURED
TO BURST AT THE SAFE LIMIT OF PRESSURE. THE PLUG THREADS AND SEATS
SHOULD BE CLEANED WITH A CLOTH (FIG 29) BEFORE INSTALLING PLUGS. SCREW
IN DEFLECTOR TUBE, USING HAND PRESSURE. THE TUBE OUTLET SHOULD FACE TO
THE REAR AND AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE TO OPERATORS LEFT SHOULDER. (FIG 18)
REPLACE LOCK NUT AND TIGHTEN WITH WRENCH. (USE WRENCH ON LOCK NUT, NOT
ON DEFLECTOR TUBE.)

D. MAINTENANCE OF PLUGS. REPLACE SAFETY HEAD IF DAMAGED OR BLOWN.
NEVER REPAIR SAFETY HEAD OR USE AN IMPROVISED HEAD.

70. TANK COUPLING.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. THIS QUICK-CONNECTING COUPLING (FIG
42) CONNECTS AND LOCKS THE FUEL HOSE OR THE COUPLING PLUG TO THE TANK
GROUP. THE COUPLING CAMS, LOCK, AND WASHER PROVIDE A SECURE AND TIGHT
JOINT. THE TANK COUPLING MAKES POSSIBLE RAPID REPLACEMENT OF EMPTIED
TANK GROUPS WITH FILLED AND CHARGED TANK GROUPS IN THE FIELD. NO TOOLS
ARE NEEDED FOR THIS OPERATION.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 42. TANK COUPLING AND END OF FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY.]

B. REMOVAL.

 (1) TO REMOVE THE TANK COUPLING FROM THE HOSE CONNECTOR, APPLY A
 WRENCH AND UNSCREW.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 43. CLOSING CAMS OF TANK COUPLING TO CONNECT GUN AND
TANK GROUP. THIS IS DONE BEFORE LOCKING. (SEE BELOW.)]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 44. CLOSING LOCK OF TANK COUPLING TO SECURE GUN TO
TANK GROUP. THIS ALSO PROVIDES A FUEL-TIGHT SEAL.]

 (2) TO DISCONNECT THE TANK COUPLING FROM THE FUEL HOSE OR THE
 COUPLING PLUG:

 (A) RELEASE PRESSURE FROM FUEL TANKS BY OPERATING THE FUEL VALVE
 OR BY OPENING VERY SLIGHTLY THE FILLING PLUG.

 (B) USING HANDS, PIVOT THE COUPLING LOCK BACK ON THE COUPLING

 (2) INSERT COUPLING PLUG OR HOSE NIPPLE, TANK END, IN THE COUPLING AS
 FAR AS IT WILL REACH. CLOSE THE TWO CAMS. (FIG 43)

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 45. COUPLING PLUG IN PLACE IN TANK COUPLING. THIS
ARRANGEMENT IS USED WHEN FUEL TANKS ARE BROUGHT BACK FOR FILLING WITH
GUN DETACHED.]

 (3) CLOSE THE COUPLING LOCK (FIG 44), BEING SURE TO PUSH IT ALL THE
 WAY, UNTIL IT COVERS THE ENDS OF BOTH CAMS. (FIGURE 45 SHOWS COUPLING
 LOCK CORRECTLY LOCKED ON COUPLING PLUG.)

 (4) IF THE TANK COUPLING HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE HOSE CONNECTOR,
 SCREW IT ON HAND TIGHT. ANTI-SEIZE COMPOUND SHOULD BE APPLIED LIGHTLY
 TO THE THREADS TO ASSURE A TIGHT JOINT. USE WRENCH TO TIGHTEN THE
 COUPLING UNTIL IT IS IN THE POSITION SHOWN IN FIGURE 34.

D. MAINTENANCE OF TANK COUPLING. THE COUPLING WASHER, MADE OF
SYNTHETIC RUBBER, SHOULD BE INSPECTED FREQUENTLY. IF IT IS DAMAGED OR
SWOLLEN, REMOVE IT AND REPLACE. IF THE COUPLING LEAKS, INSPECT, AND IF
NECESSARY, REMOVE AND REPLACE THE WASHER.

71. CARRIER.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIG 46) THE TANK GROUP IS SECURELY
CARRIED ON THE FIRERS BACK AND CHEST BY THE CARRIER, WHICH INCLUDES
THE METAL CARRIER FRAME, THE CANVAS CARRIER PACK, WEBBING STRAPS, AND
CORD, ALL OF WHICH ARE PARTS OF THE TANK GROUP.

 (1) CARRIER FRAME. THIS LIGHTWEIGHT, TUBULAR-METAL FRAME IS BOLTED
 TO TWO PAIRS OF BRACKETS (UPPER AND LOWER) ON THE FUEL TANKS. IT IS
 ALSO BOLTED TO THE HOSE CONNECTOR BY THE FRAME CLAMP, WHICH HELPS
 SUPPORT THE CONNECTOR. THE FRAME IS PIERCED BY TWO PARALLEL SERIES OF
 HOLES, THROUGH WHICH THE CORD (LASHING) OF THE CARRIER IS LACED.

 (2) CARRIER PACK. THIS IS A SHEET OF HEAVY CANVAS, REINFORCED ON
 THE TANK SIDE WITH STRIPS OF WEBBING. THE SMOOTH SIDE OF THE CARRIER
 PACK RESTS AGAINST THE FIRERS BACK AND CUSHIONS THE BACK FROM
 CONTACT WITH THE METAL TANKS. A SERIES OF EYELETS IS LOCATED ON EACH
 SIDE OF THE PACK.

 (3) SEINE CORD (LASHING). THE CARRIER PACK IS FASTENED TO THE
 CARRIER FRAME BY MEANS OF HARD-BRAIDED CORD WHICH IS LACED THROUGH
 THE EYELETS IN THE PACK AND THE HOLES IN THE FRAME. THE CORD THAT
 COMES ON THE FLAME THROWER STRETCHES VERY LITTLE UNDER LOAD.

 (4) STRAPS. THE STRAPS, MADE OF WIDE COTTON WEBBING, ARE
 ADJUSTABLE TO FIT THE WEARER. (FIG 18) THEY ARE PROVIDED WITH SNAP
 RELEASE, HOOK-AND-EYE, AND SNAP FASTENERS. THE SHOULDER STRAPS HAVE
 QUICK-RELEASE FASTENERS FOR RAPID REMOVAL, IF NECESSARY, OF THE TANK
 GROUP FROM THE FIRER. THE UPPER ENDS (STEEL LOOPS) OF THE SHOULDER
 STRAPS ARE SECURED BY PINS TO THE STEEL SUPPORT WHICH CONNECTS THE
 TWO FUEL TANKS. EACH OF THE PINS IS HELD IN POSITION BY A SPLIT
 COTTER PIN, WHICH IS INSERTED THROUGH A HOLE IN THE PIN AND IS
 THEN SPREAD. THE LOWER ENDS OF THE SHOULDER STRAPS SNAP ONTO METAL
 LOOPS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CARRIER FRAME. THE UPPER BODY STRAPS ARE
 ATTACHED TO METAL LOOPS ON EACH SIDE OF THE CARRIER FRAME. THE LOWER
 BODY STRAPS ARE FASTENED TO ONE OF THE LOWER TWO PAIRS OF EYELETS OF
 THE CARRIER PACK.

B. REMOVAL OF CARRIER.

 (1) TO REMOVE CARRIER OR CARRIER FRAME, USE SCREW DRIVER AND
 ADJUSTABLE-END WRENCH TO TAKE OFF FRAME CLAMP, BOLT, NUT, AND LOCK
 WASHER. (FIG 34) THEN REMOVE TWO PAIRS OF BOLTS, NUTS, AND LOCK
 WASHERS WHICH HOLD THE CARRIER FRAME TO BOTTOM AND TOP OF THE FUEL
 TANKS. LIFT OFF THE CARRIER.

 (2) TO REMOVE BODY STRAPS, UNSNAP ENDS AND LIFT OUT OF HOLES. TO
 REMOVE SHOULDER STRAPS, UNSNAP LOWER ENDS AND REMOVE FROM HOLES. PULL
 OUT COTTER PINS, THEN PINS, FROM UPPER ENDS OF SHOULDER STRAPS, AND
 LIFT OUT STRAPS.

 (3) TO REMOVE CARRIER PACK, UNKNOT AND UNLACE CORD.

C. INSTALLATION OF CARRIER.

 (1) TO INSTALL CARRIER FRAME (OR A COMPLETE CARRIER) PLACE FRAME IN
 POSITION ADJACENT TO FUEL TANKS (FIG 46), INSERT BOLTS IN HOLES,
 PLACE LOCK WASHERS AND NUTS ON BOLTS, AND TIGHTEN WITH SCREW DRIVER
 AND WRENCH. REPLACE FRAME CLAMP ON FUEL CONNECTOR AND FRAME. INSERT
 BOLT IN HOLES, PLACE LOCK WASHER AND NUT ON BOLT. TIGHTEN WITH SCREW
 DRIVER AND WRENCH.

 (2) IF CARRIER PACK HAS BEEN REMOVED, USE CORD TO RELASH. LACE TIGHT
 AND USE SLIP-PROOF KNOTS. (FIG 46)

 (3) TO INSTALL STRAPS, SNAP ENDS OF BODY STRAPS AND LOWER ENDS OF
 SHOULDER STRAPS INTO POSITIONS SHOWN IN FIGURE 46. PLACE UPPER ENDS
 (STEEL LOOPS) OF SHOULDER STRAPS IN STEEL SUPPORT BETWEEN FUEL TANKS.
 INSERT TWO PINS THROUGH ANY TWO OF THE HOLES IN THE SUPPORT AND
 THROUGH THE SHOULDER STRAP LOOPS. INSERT COTTER PINS IN HOLES IN PINS
 AND SPREAD COTTER PINS TO LOCK PINS IN PLACE.

D. ADJUSTMENT OF CARRIER. CARRIER MUST BE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED TO FIT
THE INDIVIDUAL FIRER SO THE LOAD WILL NOT SHIFT DURING SUDDEN, RAPID
CHANGES OF FIRERS POSITION. ADJUSTMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

 (1) CORD AND CARRIER PACK. CORD MUST BE TIGHT AT ALL TIMES. THE
 CORD FURNISHED WITH THE EQUIPMENT HAS VERY LITTLE TENDENCY TO
 STRETCH. HOWEVER, PULL CORD TIGHT WHEN LACING AND USE SLIP-PROOF
 KNOTS AT ENDS. TIGHTEN CORD PERIODICALLY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 46. CARRIER ASSEMBLED ON TANK GROUP.]

 (2) STRAPS. ADJUST STRAPS TO FIT EACH FIRER, MOVING SLIDES ON
 STRAPS AS NECESSARY. STRAPS MUST FIT SNUGLY TO PREVENT SHIFTING OF
 LOAD AND TO KEEP TANK GROUP HIGH ON FIRERS BACK. LOWER BODY STRAPS
 MAY BE FASTENED IN SECOND PAIR FROM THE BOTTOM OF CARRIER EYELETS TO
 CONFORM TO FIRERS PHYSIQUE. PINS, WHICH HOLD TOP ENDS OF SHOULDER
 STRAPS TO STEEL SUPPORT BETWEEN THE FUEL TANKS, MAY BE MOVED TO ANY
 TWO OF THE THREE HOLES SO AS TO PROVIDE THE BEST BALANCE IN THE LOAD.

E. MAINTENANCE OF CARRIER. KEEP CARRIER DRY AND CLEAN. IF FLAME
THROWER BECOMES WET OR MUDDY, CLEAN AND DRY CARRIER THOROUGHLY. STORE
IN A DRY PLACE. IF ROTTED, MILDEWED, OR DAMAGED, REPLACE AFFECTED
PARTS. IF CORD FRAYS OR BREAKS, USE SPECIAL SEINE CORD FROM SERVICE KIT
AS REPLACEMENT.

SECTION XVII GUN GROUP

72. GENERAL

THE GUN GROUP CONSISTS OF THE FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY AND THE GUN. THE GUN
INCLUDES THE FUEL VALVE, WHICH CONTROLS THE EJECTION OF FUEL, AND THE
IGNITION HEAD, WHICH IGNITES THE FUEL.

73. FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIG 47) HOSE, FUEL, FLAME THROWER,
M1, ASSEMBLY, PROVIDES A FLEXIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FUEL TANKS AND
THE GUN.

 (1) HOSE. MADE OF SYNTHETIC RUBBER AND REINFORCED WITH A COVER OF
 METAL WIRE AND COTTON BRAID, THE HOSE RESISTS THE ACTION OF GASOLINE
 AND OIL, AND WITHSTANDS A PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,000 POUNDS PER
 SQUARE INCH. ITS INSIDE DIAMETER IS 7/8 INCH; ITS OUTSIDE DIAMETER IS
 APPROXIMATELY 1-1/4 INCHES.

 (2) NIPPLES. THE HOSE NIPPLE, TANK END, CONNECTS THE HOSE TO
 THE TANK COUPLING ON THE TANK GROUP. THE HOSE NIPPLE, GUN END, IS
 A THREADED CONNECTOR BETWEEN THE OTHER END OF THE HOSE AND THE
 FUEL-VALVE BODY.

B. REMOVAL OF FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY. REMOVE THE HOSE FROM THE GUN ONLY
WHEN NECESSARY FOR MAINTENANCE. THE THREADS IN THE FUEL-VALVE BODY WILL
BE DAMAGED BY FREQUENT SCREWING AND UNSCREWING OF THE HOSE BECAUSE THE
BODY IS A LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM CASTING. FUEL HOSE IS REPLACED AS A UNIT
AND IS NOT DISASSEMBLED IN THE SECOND ECHELON. TO DISCONNECT FROM TANK
GROUP, SEE PARAGRAPH 70 B.

C. INSTALLATION OF FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY.

 (1) TO INSTALL IN TANK GROUP, SEE PARAGRAPH 70 C.

 (2) TO INSTALL IN GUN, APPLY ANTI-SEIZE COMPOUND (FROM SERVICE KIT)
 LIGHTLY TO THREADS AND SCREW HOSE IN FUEL-VALVE BODY BY HAND. USE
 WRENCH ONLY ENOUGH TO MAKE A SECURE CONNECTION.

D. MAINTENANCE OF FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY. IF THE HOSE NIPPLE, TANK END,
IS BADLY NICKED AND DOES NOT PROVIDE A TIGHT CONNECTION WITH A NEW
COUPLING WASHER (PAR 70):

 (1) FILE THE END SURFACE, BEING CAREFUL TO KEEP THE SURFACE AT A
 RIGHT ANGLE TO THE SIDES OF THE NIPPLE.

 (2) COUPLE HOSE NIPPLE, TANK END, TO TANK COUPLING. IF COUPLING
 CLOSES VERY EASILY, INDICATING WASHER IS NOT BEING COMPRESSED,
 REPLACE THE WASHER AND RECOUPLE. IF COUPLING STILL CLOSES TOO FREELY,
 THE NIPPLE HAS BEEN FILED TOO SHORT, AND THE FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY
 SHOULD BE REPLACED AS A UNIT.

74. VALVE GRIP.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIG 47) THE VALVE GRIP IS PART OF
THE FUEL VALVE. IT INCLUDES THE CONTROLS AND IS HELD BY THE FIRER IN
HIS RIGHT HAND TO SUPPORT THE GUN GROUP. PARTS OF THE VALVE GRIP ARE:

 (1) LEFT AND RIGHT VALVE GRIPS. A PISTOL-TYPE GRIP IS FORMED BY TWO
 ALUMINUM HOUSINGS DESIGNATED AS THE LEFT VALVE GRIP AND THE RIGHT
 VALVE GRIP. THE TWO PARTS ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FOUR SCREWS AND FOUR
 LOCK WASHERS.

 (2) GRIP SUPPORT. THIS ALUMINUM HOUSING IS MOUNTED ABOVE THE LEFT
 AND RIGHT VALVE GRIPS AND CONNECTED TO THEM BY TWO SCREWS AND LOCK
 WASHERS.

 (3) VALVE LEVER. THIS CONTROL IS MADE TO FIT THE FINGERS AND IS
 MOUNTED IN FRONT OF AND BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS OF THE VALVE GRIP. A
 PIN AT THE TOP OF THE LEVER FITS INTO HOLES IN LEFT AND RIGHT VALVE
 GRIPS AND SERVES AS A PIVOT, GOVERNING THE MOVEMENT OF THE LEVER.
 WHEN THE LEVER AND THE GRIP SAFETY ARE COMPRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY
 THE OPERATOR, THE VALVE IS THEREBY OPENED AND FUEL IS EJECTED FROM
 THE GUN.

 (4) GRIP SAFETY. THIS CONTROL IS GRASPED BY THE HAND SIMULTANEOUSLY
 WITH THE VALVE LEVER. IT IS MOUNTED BACK OF AND BETWEEN LEFT AND
 RIGHT VALVE GRIPS. A PIN AT THE BASE OF THE SAFETY FITS INTO HOLES
 IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT VALVE GRIPS AND SERVES AS A PIVOT IN A MANNER
 SIMILAR TO THE PIN ON THE VALVE LEVER. THE FUEL CANNOT BE DISCHARGED
 UNLESS BOTH THE VALVE LEVER AND THE GRIP SAFETY ARE COMPRESSED
 SIMULTANEOUSLY.

 (5) ROCKER ARM. THE ROCKER ARM, A BOAT-SHAPED METAL PART, IS
 MOUNTED NEAR ITS CENTER ON A PIN. IT IS HELD IN CONTACT WITH THE
 VALVE LEVER BY MEANS OF A VALVE-GRIP SPRING AND SPRING PIN. AT ITS
 TOP END, THE ROCKER ARM TOUCHES THE YOKE SHAFT OF THE VALVE-DIAPHRAGM
 ASSEMBLY. WHEN THE VALVE LEVER AND THE GRIP SAFETY ARE COMPRESSED,
 THE ROCKER ARM PUSHES THE VALVE DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY FORWARD.

 (6) VALVE-GRIP SPRING. WHEN THE FIRERS HAND RELEASES THE VALVE
 GRIP, THE VALVE-GRIP SPRING FORCES THE VALVE LEVER, THE GRIP SAFETY,
 AND THE ROCKER ARM BACK TO THEIR NORMAL, NONOPERATING POSITIONS.

B. REMOVAL OF VALVE GRIP.

 (1) UNSCREW THE FOUR SCREWS AND LOCK WASHERS THAT HOLD THE GRIP
 SUPPORT TO THE VALVE BODY. REMOVE THE VALVE GRIP AS A UNIT.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 47. FUEL VALVE (DISASSEMBLED) AND FUEL HOSE,
SHOWING NOMENCLATURE AND CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE STOCK NUMBERS FOR
REQUISITIONING SPARE PARTS.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 48. LOCATION OF PARTS IN RIGHT VALVE GRIP BEFORE
COVERING THEM WITH LEFT VALVE GRIP.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 49. USING SCREW DRIVER TO PUSH LONG END OF
VALVE-GRIP SPRING INTO GROOVE IN GRIP SAFETY.]

 (2) TO DISASSEMBLE VALVE GRIP, REMOVE SCREWS AND LOCK WASHERS FROM
 THE GRIP. LIFT OFF THE LEFT VALVE GRIP, EXPOSING CONTENTS OF GRIP.
 LIFT OUT THE FOLLOWING PARTS: VALVE-GRIP SPRING, ROCKER ARM, GRIP
 SAFETY, AND VALVE LEVER.

C. INSTALLING VALVE GRIP.

 (1) PLACE GRIP SAFETY, VALVE LEVER, AND ROCKER ARM IN POSITION IN
 RIGHT VALVE GRIP. (FIG 48) BE SURE THE SHORTER END OF ROCKER ARM IS
 AT THE TOP. PLACE GRIP SPRING OVER SPRING PIN. SLIP SHORT END OF GRIP
 SPRING IN GROOVE OF ROCKER ARM. PLACE LONG END OF GRIP SPRING ON
 OUTSIDE OF GRIP SAFETY.

 (2) PUT LEFT VALVE GRIP IN PLACE AND INSERT THE TWO LOWER LOCK
 WASHERS AND SCREWS. TIGHTEN THE TWO SCREWS ENOUGH TO HOLD PARTS IN
 PLACE AND STILL LEAVE SPACE FOR MOVING LONG END OF SPRING INTO THE
 GROOVE IN GRIP SAFETY. PUSH SPRING INTO GROOVE WITH A SCREW DRIVER.
 (FIG 49)

 (3) WITH SPRING IN PLACE, FULLY TIGHTEN THE TWO SCREWS WITH SCREW
 DRIVER.

 (4) PLACE GRIP SUPPORT IN POSITION, AND INSERT THE TWO UPPER LOCK
 WASHERS AND SCREWS. TIGHTEN SCREWS, USING SCREW DRIVER.

 (5) ATTACH VALVE GRIP TO VALVE BODY, USING THE FOUR LOCK WASHERS AND
 INSERTING THE FOUR SCREWS THROUGH THE GRIP SUPPORT. MAKE SURE THAT
 THE YOKE SHAFT OF THE VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY IS IN FRONT OF ROCKER
 ARM.

D. MAINTENANCE OF VALVE GRIP. NO MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED FOR THE
VALVE GRIP OTHER THAN REPLACEMENT OF WORN OR DAMAGED PARTS, TIGHTENING
OF SCREWS, CLEANING, AND LUBRICATION. (PAR 49)

75. BARREL AND VALVE-BODY ASSEMBLY.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIG 47) THIS ASSEMBLY IS PART OF THE
FUEL VALVE. IT INCLUDES THE BARREL, VALVE BODY, AND OPERATING PARTS
CONTAINED IN THE BARREL AND VALVE BODY. THE ASSEMBLY CONSISTS OF:

 (1) VALVE BODY, AN ALUMINUM HOUSING, LOCATED AT THE REAR OF THE
 GUN AND MOUNTED ON THE GRIP SUPPORT BY MEANS OF FOUR SCREWS AND LOCK
 WASHERS. THE VALVE BODY HAS FOUR LARGE THREADED OPENINGS. THE LOWER
 OPENING LEADS INTO THE VALVE GRIP. THE SIDE OPENING, WHICH FORMS A
 Y WITH THE MAIN PORTION OF THE BODY, IS CONNECTED TO THE FUEL-HOSE
 ASSEMBLY. THE FRONT OPENING IS SCREWED ON THE BARREL. THE REAR
 OPENING IS CLOSED BY THE SPRING RETAINER AND PLUG.

 (2) VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY, WHICH TRANSMITS AND REVERSES THE
 MOVEMENT IMPARTED TO IT BY THE ROCKER ARM OF THE VALVE GRIP. (PAR 74
 A) IT ALSO SERVES AS A SEAL, KEEPING FUEL FROM ENTERING THE VALVE
 GRIP. THE VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY INCLUDES:

 (A) YOKE SHAFT, ON WHICH THE ROCKER ARM BEARS AT THE LOWER END
 OF THE SHAFT.

 (B) YOKE, A Y-SHAPED METAL PART WHICH FITS ON THE UPPER END OF
 THE YOKE SHAFT AND IS HELD TO IT BY A STEEL PIN. THE YOKE TRANSMITS
 MOTION FROM THE SHAFT TO THE YOKE BLOCK, AND IS LOCATED WITHIN THE
 VALVE BODY WHEN THE VALVE IS ASSEMBLED.

 (C) DIAPHRAGM, A SYNTHETIC-RUBBER DIAPHRAGM HELD IN A STEEL
 SLEEVE, WHICH FITS SNUGLY IN THE LOWER OPENING OF THE VALVE BODY.
 THE YOKE SHAFT PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPHRAGM.

 (3) DIAPHRAGM SUPPORT, WASHER, AND CAP, WHICH HOLD THE
 VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY IN PLACE IN THE VALVE BODY.

 (4) SPRING RETAINER, A BRASS, HOLLOW BUSHING WHICH SCREWS INTO THE
 REAR OPENING OF THE VALVE BODY, AND WHICH IS THREADED INTERNALLY
 TO RECEIVE THE PLUG. THE RETAINER HAS A HEXAGONAL HEAD TO TAKE A
 1-3/8-INCH WRENCH. AS ITS NAME IMPLIES, THE RETAINER HOLDS THE VALVE
 SPRING IN POSITION.

 (5) PLUG, A BRASS PART, RESEMBLING A CAP SCREW, WHICH FITS INTO
 THE SPRING RETAINER, CLOSING OFF THE REAR END OF THE GUN. IT PERMITS
 ADJUSTMENT OF THE NEEDLE (SEE D BELOW) WITHOUT REMOVING THE VALVE
 SPRING AND SPRING RETAINER.

 (6) VALVE SPRING, A COIL SPRING LOCATED IN THE VALVE BODY BETWEEN
 THE SPRING RETAINER AND THE YOKE BLOCK. THE SPRING KEEPS THE NEEDLE
 SEATED IN THE NOZZLE UNTIL COMPRESSION OF THE GRIP SAFETY AND VALVE
 LEVER FORCES BACK THE YOKE BLOCK, SPRING, AND NEEDLE.

 (7) YOKE BLOCK, A STEEL PIECE, 1 INCH LONG, WHICH FITS INTO THE
 ARMS OF THE YOKE Y. IT IS SECURED BY AN INTERNAL THREAD TO THE VALVE
 NEEDLE. MOVEMENT OF THE YOKE IN TURN MOVES THE YOKE BLOCK AND THE
 VALVE NEEDLE.

 (8) LOCK NUT, ON THE VALVE-NEEDLE THREAD AT THE REAR OF THE YOKE
 BLOCK, WHICH LOCKS THE BLOCK ON THE NEEDLE.

 (9) VALVE-NEEDLE, A POINTED ROD, WHICH EXTENDS THROUGH THE INSIDE
 OF THE BARREL FROM THE YOKE BLOCK TO THE NOZZLE. THE VALVE NEEDLE IS
 SEATED IN THE NOZZLE EXCEPT WHEN FIRING. IT CONTROLS THE EJECTION
 OF FUEL FROM THE NOZZLE. TWO SETS OF THREE FINS EACH, KNOWN AS
 NEEDLE GUIDES, ARE MOUNTED ON THE FRONT AND REAR OF THE NEEDLE,
 RESPECTIVELY. THESE GUIDES KEEP THE NEEDLE CENTERED IN THE BARREL.
 THE REAR END OF THE VALVE NEEDLE IS THREADED TO HOLD THE YOKE BLOCK
 AND PERMIT ADJUSTMENT OF THE NEEDLE BY MEANS OF THE LOCK NUT WHICH
 SCREWS ON THE THREADS. (SEE D BELOW.)

 (10) BARREL (FIGS 47 AND 54), WHICH CARRIES THE FUEL TO THE
 IGNITION HEAD. IT ALSO SUPPORTS OR CONTAINS OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE
 GUN. THE BARREL ASSEMBLY IS REPLACED AS A UNIT WITH THE NEEDLE. IT
 CONSISTS OF A TUBE, MADE OF THIN METAL, WITH A THREADED FITTING AT
 THE BACK END, AND A NOZZLE BRAZED INTO THE FRONT END OF THE TUBE. THE
 NOZZLE EJECTS THE FUEL FROM THE BARREL THROUGH THE IGNITION HEAD. THE
 FUEL EMERGES FROM TWO HOLES IN THE NOZZLE:

 (A) ATOMIZER HOLE, A SMALL OPENING WHICH SPRAYS A FINE, READILY
 IGNITED MIST OF FUEL. THIS HELPS IGNITE THE MAIN STREAM OF FUEL.

 (B) MAIN HOLE, WHICH IS TAPERED INSIDE, AND WHICH CONVEYS THE
 MAIN STREAM OF FUEL FROM THE BARREL. WHEN THE GUN IS NOT BEING
 FIRED, THE VALVE NEEDLE IS SEATED IN THE MAIN HOLE OF THE NOZZLE.
 WHEN THE GUN IS BEING FIRED, THE NEEDLE IS WITHDRAWN FROM THE
 NOZZLE SEAT, PERMITTING THE FUEL TO BE FORCED FROM THE GUN.

B. REMOVAL OF BARREL AND VALVE-BODY ASSEMBLY. IF GUN GROUP AND
TANK GROUP ARE CONNECTED, RELEASE ANY PRESSURE IN THE FUEL TANKS BY
COMPRESSING THE VALVE LEVER AND THE GRIP SAFETY. THEN DISASSEMBLE AS
FOLLOWS:

 (1) UNSCREW THE FUEL-HOSE ASSEMBLY FROM THE FUEL-VALVE BODY ONLY IF
 THIS IS NECESSARY FOR MAINTENANCE.

 (2) REMOVE SPRING RETAINER AND PLUG FROM END OF FUEL-VALVE BODY AND
 REMOVE VALVE SPRING.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 50. VALVE NEEDLE, YOKE BLOCK, AND LOCK NUT READY FOR
INSTALLATION IN FUEL-VALVE BODY.]

 (3) UNSCREW DIAPHRAGM CAP AND PULL OUT WASHER, SUPPORT, AND
 VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY. TO PREVENT LOSS OF VALVE-NEEDLE ADJUSTMENT
 (FIG 54), DO NOT DISTURB POSITION OF YOKE BLOCK BY TURNING THE NEEDLE.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 51. PLACING DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY IN POSITION IN
FUEL-VALVE BODY.]

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 52. INSTALLING PARTS IN FUEL-VALVE BODY.]

 (4) SLIDE THE VALVE NEEDLE OUT OF BARREL; THE YOKE BLOCK AND THE LOCK
 NUT MAY THEN BE UNSCREWED FROM THE VALVE NEEDLE, BUT ADJUSTMENT (SEE
 D BELOW) WILL BE NECESSARY WHEN REINSTALLING.

C. INSTALLATION OF BARREL AND VALVE-BODY ASSEMBLY.

 (1) TO INSTALL VALVE NEEDLE, SCREW THE YOKE BLOCK AND LOCK NUT ON THE
 NEEDLE (FIG 50). INSERT NEEDLE IN VALVE BODY AND BARREL.

 (2) INSERT VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY INTO VALVE BODY (FIG 51), MAKING
 SURE THAT THE YOKE SLIPS INTO THE FLAT NOTCHES OF YOKE BLOCK.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 53. INSTALLING SPRING RETAINER IN FUEL-VALVE BODY.]

 (3) SLIP THE DIAPHRAGM SUPPORT, WASHER, AND CAP OVER THE YOKE SHAFT.
 (FIG 52) SCREW ON THE DIAPHRAGM CAP BY HAND. DO NOT USE A WRENCH.
 INSTALL VALVE GRIP. (PAR 74 C)

 (4) PLACE VALVE SPRING OVER END OF NEEDLE AND INSTALL SPRING
 RETAINER. (FIG 53) APPLY WRENCH VERY LIGHTLY TO TIGHTEN SPRING
 RETAINER.

 (5) ADJUST NEEDLE (SEE D BELOW), AND SCREW PLUG INTO THE SPRING
 RETAINER.

 (6) IF HOSE HAS BEEN REMOVED, APPLY ANTI-SEIZE COMPOUND LIGHTLY
 TO THE THREADS. SCREW HOSE INTO FUEL-VALVE BODY. WRENCH SHOULD BE
 APPLIED VERY LIGHTLY TO TIGHTEN.

D. ADJUSTMENT OF VALVE NEEDLE. NEEDLE IS ADJUSTED AFTER INSTALLATION
OF PARTS IN BARREL AND VALVE ASSEMBLY. USE CARE WHEN RESETTING NEEDLE,
AS SMOOTH OPERATION OF THE WEAPON DEPENDS ON ACCURATE ADJUSTMENT.

 (1) REMOVE IGNITION SHIELD (PAR 18) AND PLUG FROM GUN.

 (2) USE THE VALVE-ADJUSTING WRENCH (FIG 8) TO HOLD THE LOCK NUT AND
 APPLY A CABINET (NARROW-BLADED) SCREW DRIVER (FIG 8) IN THE END OF
 THE NEEDLE. TURN NEEDLE UNTIL IT MAKES A SNUG FIT IN THE NOZZLE
 OPENING.

 (3) COMPRESS THE VALVE LEVER AND GRIP SAFETY. THE NEEDLE SHOULD DRAW
 BACK INTO THE NOZZLE WITH THE TIP OF THE NEEDLE AT THE SMALLEST
 DIAMETER OPENING IN THE NOZZLE. (FIG 54)

 (4) WHEN THE NEEDLE HAS BEEN CORRECTLY ADJUSTED, AS IN (3) ABOVE,
 TIGHTEN THE LOCK NUT WITH THE VALVE-ADJUSTING WRENCH, KEEPING THE
 NEEDLE FROM TURNING WITH THE SCREW DRIVER. THIS WILL LOCK THE
 ADJUSTMENT. SCREW PLUG INTO THE SPRING RETAINER.

 (5) REPLACE IGNITION SHIELD. (PAR 18)

E. MAINTENANCE OF BARREL AND VALVE BODY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 54. VALVE-NEEDLE ADJUSTMENT. SOLID LINES SHOW NEEDLE
IN CORRECT OPEN POSITION WITH POINT AT SMALLEST DIAMETER OF NOZZLE.
BROKEN LINES SHOW NEEDLE IN CLOSED POSITION.]

 (1) DAMAGED PARTS. REPLACE WORN OR DAMAGED PARTS. IF THE DIAPHRAGM
 SHOWS EVIDENCE OF TEARS OR SEPARATION, OR IF LEAKS OCCUR AT THE
 DIAPHRAGM, REPLACE THE VALVE-DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLY.

 (2) VALVE SPRING. IF VALVE SPRING HAS LOST RESILIENCY, GRASP IT BY
 THE ENDS AND STRETCH SLIGHTLY, OR REPLACE.

 (3) NOZZLE LEAKS. IF VALVE LEAKS AT NOZZLE, AND CLEANING (PAR 55
 D) DOES NOT REMEDY THE LEAK, ADJUST NEEDLE (SEE D ABOVE). IF
 LEAK PERSISTS, EITHER REPLACE BARREL AND NEEDLE, OR LAP SEAT. TO
 LAP, PLACE LAPPING COMPOUND ON SEAT (IN NOZZLE) AND ON NEEDLE POINT.
 TURN NEEDLE IN SEAT UNTIL PARTS MAKE A TIGHT CONNECTION WHEN SEATED.
 REMOVE LAPPING COMPOUND, REASSEMBLE, ADJUST NEEDLE, AND TEST FIRE.

 (4) ATOMIZER HOLE. IF ATOMIZER HOLE IS CLOGGED, CLEAN WITH FINE
 WIRE. (PAR 52 I)

76. IGNITION HEAD.

A. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING. (FIG 55) THE IGNITION HEAD IGNITES
THE FUEL WHEN THE FLAME THROWER IS FIRED. IT IS MOUNTED ON THE FORE
PART OF THE BARREL. IT CONSISTS OF:

 (1) IGNITION-HEAD BODY, WHICH INCLUDES HALF OF THE FRONT GRIP.
 THREE SET SCREWS SERVE TO TIGHTEN THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY TO THE
 BARREL. THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY IS MADE OF ALUMINUM.

 (2) TRIGGER AND TRIGGER BEARING, HELD BETWEEN THE IGNITION-HEAD
 BODY AND THE COVERPLATE BY THE TRIGGER SCREW.

 (3) TRIGGER ROD, ONE END OF WHICH IS HELD IN THE TRIGGER BEARING,
 THE OTHER EXTENDING THROUGH THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY. PULLING THE
 TRIGGER SHOVES THE TRIGGER ROD FORWARD, CAUSING IT TO PUSH A MATCH IN
 THE IGNITION CYLINDER. THE MATCH IGNITES AN INCENDIARY CHARGE IN THE
 IGNITION CYLINDER.

 (4) TRIGGER SPRING, WHICH HOOKS OVER A PROJECTION OF THE TRIGGER
 AND IS HELD AT ITS LOWER END BY A SCREW, WHICH IS HELD IN THE
 IGNITION-HEAD BODY. THIS SPRING PULLS THE TRIGGER ROD BACK FROM THE
 FIRING POSITION AFTER THE FIRER RELEASES THE TRIGGER.

 (5) LATCH, LOCATED IN THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY, IN FRONT OF AND ABOVE
 THE TRIGGER GUARD. THE LATCH, SET ON A PIN, ENGAGES THE NOTCH OF THE
 IGNITION SHIELD, LOCKING IT IN PLACE. A LATCH SPRING HOLDS LATCH IN
 POSITION.

 (6) COVERPLATE, AN ALUMINUM CASTING WHICH CONSTITUTES THE LEFT
 SECTION OF THE FRONT GRIP AND COVERS THE WORKING PARTS SEATED IN THE
 IGNITION HEAD BODY. THE COVERPLATE AND BODY ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FOUR
 SCREWS AND FOUR LOCK WASHERS.

 (7) SPRING CASE, WHICH TURNS THE IGNITION CYLINDER WHEN THE TRIGGER
 IS PULLED.

 (A) FOUR PROJECTIONS ON THE INNER SPRING CASE ARE BENT OVER THE
 OUTER SPRING CASE TO HOLD THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER.

 (B) THE INNER-CASE PIN (FIG 56) ENGAGES A STOP ON THE INSIDE OF
 THE IGNITION CYLINDER. THE FIVE PROJECTING METAL MATCHES ON THE
 INSIDE OF THE IGNITION CYLINDER ARE EACH IN TURN STOPPED BY THE LUG
 ON THE FORWARD-FACING SURFACE OF THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 55. IGNITION HEAD DISASSEMBLED, SHOWING NOMENCLATURE
AND CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE STOCK NUMBERS FOR REQUISITIONING SPARE
PARTS.]

 WHEN THE TRIGGER IS PULLED, THE TRIGGER ROD PUSHES A MATCH FORWARD,
 CAUSING AN INCENDIARY CHARGE IN THE IGNITION CYLINDER TO IGNITE.
 THE SPRING IN THE CASE ROTATES THE IGNITION CYLINDER UNTIL ANOTHER
 MATCH IS STOPPED BY THE LUG.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 56. PARTS OF IGNITION HEAD AND IGNITION CYLINDER.]

 (C) THE OUTER-CASE PIN (ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE OUTER
 SPRING CASE) FITS INTO THE NOTCH IN THE IGNITION SHIELD AND HOLDS
 THE SPRING CASE AS THE SHIELD IS SCREWED INTO POSITION. THIS ACTION
 WINDS THE SPRING IN THE CASE.

 (D) A SNAP RING HOLDS THE SPRING CASE ON THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY.

 (8) IGNITION SHIELD, A CYLINDRICAL, THIN-METAL TUBE WITH A CONICAL
 FRONT END. THE SHIELD GUIDES THE FLAME AND PROTECTS THE FIRER. EIGHT
 HOLES AROUND THE BASE OF THE CONE PROVIDE AN AIR INTAKE FOR BURNING
 THE FUEL. THE BASE OF THE SHIELD IS THREADED, AND IT SCREWS ONTO
 THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY. A NOTCH (FIG 56) IN THE BASE OF THE SHIELD
 RECEIVES THE LATCH AND THE OUTER-CASE PIN OF THE SPRING CASE.

B. REMOVAL OF IGNITION HEAD. TO REMOVE THE IGNITION HEAD, PROCEED AS
FOLLOWS:

 (1) REMOVE SHIELD BY LIFTING LATCH AND UNSCREWING SHIELD
 COUNTERCLOCKWISE. (FIG 14) KEEP HANDS AND FACE AWAY FROM FRONT OF
 BARREL.

 (2) IF IGNITION CYLINDER HAS NOT BEEN REMOVED, REMOVE IT OR ALLOW IT
 TO FALL OFF BARREL.

 (3) PRY OFF SNAP RING WHICH HOLDS SPRING CASE IN POSITION, USING
 SCREW DRIVER. (FIG 57) BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE OR BREAK THE
 IGNITION-HEAD BODY BY APPLYING TOO MUCH LEVERAGE.

 (4) REMOVE THE FOUR SCREWS AND LOCK WASHERS WHICH HOLD IGNITION-HEAD
 BODY AND COVERPLATE TOGETHER. LIFT OFF COVERPLATE.

 (5) TRIGGER, TRIGGER SPRING, TRIGGER ROD, LATCH, AND LATCH SPRING MAY
 BE REMOVED.

 (6) USING A HEX WRENCH, LOOSEN SET SCREWS (FIG 58) AND WITHDRAW
 BARREL FROM IGNITION HEAD.

C. INSTALLATION OF IGNITION HEAD. TO INSTALL IGNITION HEAD, PROCEED
AS FOLLOWS:

 (1) INSERT BARREL IN IGNITION-HEAD BODY, PUSHING IT AS FAR FORWARD AS
 THE SHOULDER ON THE BARREL PERMITS.

 (2) ALINE FRONT GRIP AND VALVE GRIP.

 (3) USING HEX WRENCH, TIGHTEN SET SCREWS ON BARREL ENOUGH TO HOLD BUT
 NOT SO TIGHT THAT BARREL IS DENTED.

 (4) PLACE LATCH, LATCH SPRING, TRIGGER AND BEARING, TRIGGER ROD, AND
 TRIGGER SPRING IN POSITION.

 (5) PUT COVERPLATE ON IGNITION-HEAD BODY AND REPLACE THE FOUR LOCK
 WASHERS AND SCREWS.

 (6) SLIP SPRING CASE OVER BARREL, AND LOCK BY FORCING SNAP RING INTO
 THE GROOVE.

 (7) WHEN WEAPON IS TO BE USED ON A MISSION, FIT IGNITION CYLINDER
 AND IGNITION SHIELD IN PLACE ON NOZZLE END OF BARREL AS DESCRIBED IN
 PARAGRAPH 18.

D. MAINTENANCE OF IGNITION HEAD.

 (1) SERVICING. THE IGNITION HEAD SHOULD BE CLEANED AND LUBRICATED
 EACH TIME IT IS DISASSEMBLED. (PAR 49)

 (2) SPRING-CASE ASSEMBLY. IF OUTER CASE ROTATES AND INNER CASE DOES
 NOT, AND NO SPRING ACTION OCCURS, SPRING IS BROKEN AND SPRING CASE
 SHOULD BE REPLACED AS A UNIT. DO NOT DISASSEMBLE OR REPAIR THIS PART.

 (3) TRIGGER ROD AND LUG. WHEN TRIGGER IS PULLED ALL THE WAY, END
 OF TRIGGER ROD SHOULD EXTEND 1/16 INCH BEYOND LUG ON FORWARD-FACING
 SURFACE OF IGNITION-HEAD BODY. IF END OF TRIGGER ROD IS WORN, REPLACE
 ROD. LUG ON THE IGNITION-HEAD BODY SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 7/32 INCH
 HIGH. IF LUG IS WORN OR BROKEN, REPLACE IGNITION HEAD BODY.

[ILLUSTRATION: FIG 57. PRYING SNAP RING FROM IGNITION HEAD TO REMOVE
SPRING CASE.]
